##Title Seeking New Laws

L7-cue_1
00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:41.446
#What I want to talk to you about tonight is, strictly speaking,

L7-cue_2
00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:47.786
not on the character of physical laws, because one might imagine, at least, that one’s talking

L7-cue_3
00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:51.306
about nature when one’s talking about the character of physical laws.

L7-cue_4
00:01:51.306 --> 00:01:56.156
But I don’t want to talk about nature, but rather how we stand relative to nature now.

L7-cue_5
00:01:56.156 --> 00:02:00.896
I want to tell you what we think we know, and what there is to guess,

L7-cue_6
00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:04.856
and how one goes about guessing it.

L7-cue_7
00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:09.666
#Someone suggested that it would be ideal if, as I went along, I would slowly explain how

L7-cue_8
00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:13.246
to guess the laws, and then create a new law for you right

L7-cue_9
00:02:13.246 --> 00:02:19.896
as I went along-I don’t know whether I’ll be able to do that.

L7-cue_10
00:02:19.896 --> 00:02:24.496
#But first, I want to tell about what the present situation is—what it is

L7-cue_11
00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.316
that we know about the physics.

L7-cue_12
00:02:26.316 --> 00:02:28.786
You think that I’ve told you everything already,

L7-cue_13
00:02:28.786 --> 00:02:33.166
because in all the lectures I told you all the great principles that are known.

L7-cue_14
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.716
But the principles must be principles about something.

L7-cue_15
00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:38.366
The principle that I just spoke of,

L7-cue_16
00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:42.236
the conservation of energy, is the energy of something.

L7-cue_17
00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:47.046
Quantum mechanical laws are quantum mechanical principles about something.

L7-cue_18
00:02:47.046 --> 00:02:51.856
All these principles added together still doesn’t tell us what the content is

L7-cue_19
00:02:51.856 --> 00:02:57.186
of the nature—that is, what we’re talking about—so I will tell you a little bit

L7-cue_20
00:02:57.186 --> 00:03:01.886
about the stuff on which all these principles are supposed to have been working.

L7-cue_21
00:03:01.886 --> 00:03:09.146
#First of all, is matter—and, remarkably enough, all matter is the same:

L7-cue_22
00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:14.156
the matter of which the stars are made is known to be the same as the matter on the earth

L7-cue_23
00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:18.566
by the character of the light that’s emitted by those stars—they give a kind of fingerprint

L7-cue_24
00:03:18.566 --> 00:03:22.756
by which you can tell there’s the same kind of atoms in the stars as on the earth;

L7-cue_25
00:03:22.756 --> 00:03:25.706
the same kind of atoms appear to be in living creatures

L7-cue_26
00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:29.066
as in non—living creatures—frogs are made out of the same goop,

L7-cue_27
00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:32.266
in different arrangement, than rocks.

L7-cue_28
00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:40.916
#So that makes our problem simpler: we have nothing but atoms, all the same, everywhere.

L7-cue_29
00:03:40.916 --> 00:03:47.386
The atoms all seem to be made from the same general constitution: they have a nucleus,

L7-cue_30
00:03:47.386 --> 00:03:51.176
and around the nucleus there are electrons.

L7-cue_31
00:03:51.176 --> 00:03:56.676
So I begin to list the parts of the world that we think we know about.

L7-cue_32
00:03:56.676 --> 00:04:01.906
One of them is electrons, which are the particles on the outside of the atoms;

L7-cue_33
00:04:01.906 --> 00:04:06.946
then there are the nuclei, but those are understood today as being themselves made

L7-cue_34
00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:12.456
up of two other things, which are called neutrons and protons—two particles.

L7-cue_35
00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:21.016
#Incidentally, we have to see the stars and see the atoms and they emit light,

L7-cue_36
00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:26.206
and the light is described by particles themselves, which are called photons.

L7-cue_37
00:04:26.206 --> 00:04:30.706
#And at the beginning we spoke about gravitation, and if the quantum theory is right,

L7-cue_38
00:04:30.706 --> 00:04:36.276
then the gravitation should have some kind of waves which behave like particles, too,

L7-cue_39
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:39.166
and they call those gravitons—if you don’t believe

L7-cue_40
00:04:39.166 --> 00:04:42.896
in that, you just read gravity here, say.

L7-cue_41
00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:46.956
#Now, finally, I did mention that in what’s called beta decay,

L7-cue_42
00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:50.766
in which a neutron can disintegrate into a proton and an electron

L7-cue_43
00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:55.996
and a neutrino (or really an antineutrino), there’s another particle here, a neutrino.

L7-cue_44
00:04:55.996 --> 00:05:01.226
In addition to all the particles that I’m listing, there are, of course,

L7-cue_45
00:05:01.226 --> 00:05:04.436
all the antiparticles—but that’s just a quick statement,

L7-cue_46
00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:06.056
and it takes care of doubling the number

L7-cue_47
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:09.886
of particles immediately—but there’s no complications.

L7-cue_48
00:05:09.886 --> 00:05:14.176
#Now, with the particles that I’ve listed here—all of the low energy phenomena,

L7-cue_49
00:05:14.176 --> 00:05:19.526
all of them, in fact, ordinary phenomena that happen everywhere in the universe as far

L7-cue_50
00:05:19.526 --> 00:05:26.106
as we know (with the exception of here and there some very high energy particle does something

L7-cue_51
00:05:26.106 --> 00:05:29.266
or in a laboratory we’ve been able to do some peculiar things—but if we leave

L7-cue_52
00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:35.656
out those special cases)—all ordinary phenomena are presumably explained by the action

L7-cue_53
00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:38.686
and the motions of these things, these kind of things.

L7-cue_54
00:05:38.686 --> 00:05:43.356
#For example, life itself is supposedly made—I mean, [is] understandable

L7-cue_55
00:05:43.356 --> 00:05:47.726
in principle—from the action of movements of atoms, and those atoms are made

L7-cue_56
00:05:47.726 --> 00:05:50.786
out of neutrons, protons, and electrons.

L7-cue_57
00:05:50.786 --> 00:05:54.596
I must immediately say that when we say we understand it "in principle,"

L7-cue_58
00:05:54.596 --> 00:06:00.106
I only mean that we think we would—if we could figure everything out—find

L7-cue_59
00:06:00.106 --> 00:06:04.266
that there’s nothing new in physics to be discovered in order

L7-cue_60
00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:07.886
to understand the phenomena of life.

L7-cue_61
00:06:07.886 --> 00:06:12.736
#Or, for instance, for the fact that the stars emit energy—solar energy,

L7-cue_62
00:06:12.736 --> 00:06:16.046
or stellar energy—is presumably also understood in terms

L7-cue_63
00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:18.416
of nuclear reactions among these particles, and so on.

L7-cue_64
00:06:18.416 --> 00:06:26.396
All kinds of details of the way atoms behave are accurately described with this kind

L7-cue_65
00:06:26.396 --> 00:06:29.676
of model—at least as far as we know, at present.

L7-cue_66
00:06:29.676 --> 00:06:34.616
In fact, I can say that in this range of phenomena today, as far as I know,

L7-cue_67
00:06:34.616 --> 00:06:39.676
there are no phenomena that we are sure cannot be explained this way,

L7-cue_68
00:06:39.676 --> 00:06:42.736
or even that there’s deep mystery about.

L7-cue_69
00:06:42.736 --> 00:06:44.706
#This wasn’t always possible.

L7-cue_70
00:06:44.706 --> 00:06:49.336
There was, for instance, for a while a phenomenon called superconductivity—there still

L7-cue_71
00:06:49.336 --> 00:06:54.106
is the phenomenon—which is that metals conduct electricity

L7-cue_72
00:06:54.106 --> 00:06:55.856
without resistance at low temperatures.

L7-cue_73
00:06:55.856 --> 00:06:59.336
It was not at first obvious that this was a consequence of the known laws

L7-cue_74
00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:02.396
with these particles, but it turns out that it has been though

L7-cue_75
00:07:02.396 --> 00:07:06.946
through carefully enough that’s it’s seen, in fact, to be a consequence of known laws.

L7-cue_76
00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:12.626
#There are other phenomena, such as extrasensory perception, which cannot be explained

L7-cue_77
00:07:12.626 --> 00:07:17.426
by this known knowledge of physics here—and it is interesting, however,

L7-cue_78
00:07:17.426 --> 00:07:22.726
that that phenomenon has not been well established,

L7-cue_79
00:07:22.726 --> 00:07:26.306
that we cannot guarantee that it’s there.

L7-cue_80
00:07:26.306 --> 00:07:31.126
If it could be demonstrated, but of course that would prove that the physics is incomplete,

L7-cue_81
00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:36.276
and therefore it’s extremely interesting to physicists whether it’s right or wrong.

L7-cue_82
00:07:36.276 --> 00:07:40.526
Many, many experiments exist which show it doesn’t work.

L7-cue_83
00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:47.216
The same goes for astrological influences: if it were true that the stars could affect the day

L7-cue_84
00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:53.436
that it was good to go to the dentist (in America we have that kind of astrology),

L7-cue_85
00:07:53.436 --> 00:07:56.526
then it would be wrong—the physics theory would be wrong—

L7-cue_86
00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:59.876
because there’s no mechanism understandable in principle

L7-cue_87
00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:01.886
from these things that would make it go.

L7-cue_88
00:08:01.886 --> 00:08:11.106
That’s the reason that there’s some skepticism among scientists with regard to those ideas.

L7-cue_89
00:08:11.106 --> 00:08:13.756
#On the other hand, in the case of hypnotism, at first it looked

L7-cue_90
00:08:13.756 --> 00:08:17.886
like that also would be impossible, when it was described incompletely,

L7-cue_91
00:08:17.886 --> 00:08:22.866
but now that it’s known better, it is realized that it is not absolutely impossible

L7-cue_92
00:08:22.866 --> 00:08:25.986
that hypnosis could occur through normal physiological

L7-cue_93
00:08:25.986 --> 00:08:32.846
but unknown processes-it doesn’t require some special new kind of force.

L7-cue_94
00:08:32.846 --> 00:08:42.086
#Now, today, although the knowledge of a theory of what goes on outside the nucleus

L7-cue_95
00:08:42.086 --> 00:08:46.806
of the atom seems precise and complete enough (in the sense that, given enough time,

L7-cue_96
00:08:46.806 --> 00:08:51.896
we can calculate anything as accurately as it can be measured)—it turns out that the forces

L7-cue_97
00:08:51.896 --> 00:08:58.286
between neutrons and protons, which constitute the nucleus, are not so completely known,

L7-cue_98
00:08:58.286 --> 00:09:00.746
and are not understood at all well.

L7-cue_99
00:09:00.746 --> 00:09:05.236
What I mean by that is, that we cannot today—we do not today—understand the forces

L7-cue_100
00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:10.516
between neutrons and protons to the extent that if you wanted me to, and gave me enough time

L7-cue_101
00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:15.046
and computers, I could calculate exactly the energy levels of carbon, or something like that,

L7-cue_102
00:09:15.046 --> 00:09:19.446
because we don’t know enough about that; although we can do the corresponding thing

L7-cue_103
00:09:19.446 --> 00:09:22.496
for the energy levels of the outside, electrons of the atom,

L7-cue_104
00:09:22.496 --> 00:09:30.746
we cannot for the nuclei—so the nuclear forces are still not understood very well.

L7-cue_105
00:09:30.746 --> 00:09:36.206
#Now, in order to find out more about that, experimenters have gone on,

L7-cue_106
00:09:36.206 --> 00:09:40.836
and they have to study phenomena at very high energy, where they hit neutrons

L7-cue_107
00:09:40.836 --> 00:09:44.636
and protons together at very high energy, and produce peculiar things—and

L7-cue_108
00:09:44.636 --> 00:09:45.926
by studying those peculiar things,

L7-cue_109
00:09:45.926 --> 00:09:49.816
we hope to understand better the forces between neutrons and protons.

L7-cue_110
00:09:49.816 --> 00:09:54.646
#Well, a Pandora’s Box has been opened by these experiments, although all we really wanted was

L7-cue_111
00:09:54.646 --> 00:09:58.146
to get a better idea of the forces between neutrons and protons:

L7-cue_112
00:09:58.146 --> 00:10:00.086
when we hit these things together hard,

L7-cue_113
00:10:00.086 --> 00:10:02.686
we discover that there are more particles in the world.

L7-cue_114
00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.626
As a matter of fact, in this column,

L7-cue_115
00:10:04.626 --> 00:10:08.926
there was (plus) over four dozen other particles have been dredged

L7-cue_116
00:10:08.926 --> 00:10:14.736
up in an attempt to understand these.

L7-cue_117
00:10:14.736 --> 00:10:18.266
These four dozen other are put in this column because they’re very relevant

L7-cue_118
00:10:18.266 --> 00:10:21.756
to the neutron-proton column: they interact very much with neutrons and protons,

L7-cue_119
00:10:21.756 --> 00:10:24.606
and they’ve got something to do with the force between neutrons

L7-cue_120
00:10:24.606 --> 00:10:27.536
and protons-so we’ve got a little bit too much.

L7-cue_121
00:10:27.536 --> 00:10:31.506
#In addition to that, while the dredge was digging up all this mud over here,

L7-cue_122
00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:35.516
it picked up a couple of pieces that are not wanted, and are irrelevant

L7-cue_123
00:10:35.516 --> 00:10:38.026
to the problem of nuclear forces.

L7-cue_124
00:10:38.026 --> 00:10:43.376
One of them is called a mu meson, or muon, and the other was a neutrino which goes

L7-cue_125
00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:47.506
with it-there are two kinds of neutrinos: one which goes with the electron,

L7-cue_126
00:10:47.506 --> 00:10:49.756
and one which goes with the mu meson.

L7-cue_127
00:10:49.756 --> 00:10:54.026
#Incidentally, most amazingly, all the laws of the muon and its neutrino are now known,

L7-cue_128
00:10:54.026 --> 00:10:58.316
as far as we can tell experimentally; the laws is: they behave precisely the same

L7-cue_129
00:10:58.316 --> 00:11:04.886
as the electron and its neutrino, except that the mass of the mu meson is 207 times heavier

L7-cue_130
00:11:04.886 --> 00:11:06.846
than an electron—and that’s the only difference known

L7-cue_131
00:11:06.846 --> 00:11:09.776
between those objects—but it’s rather curious,

L7-cue_132
00:11:09.776 --> 00:11:13.816
[and] I can’t say any more, because nobody knows any more.

L7-cue_133
00:11:13.816 --> 00:11:20.846
#Now, four dozen other particles is a frightening array—plus the antiparticles—is a frightening

L7-cue_134
00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:27.036
array of things, but it turns out they’ve got various names—mesons, pions, kaons, lambdas,

L7-cue_135
00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:29.326
sigmas—it doesn’t make any difference; four dozen particles,

L7-cue_136
00:11:29.326 --> 00:11:30.676
there’re going to be a lot of names!

L7-cue_137
00:11:30.676 --> 00:11:37.726
#But it turns out that these particles come in families, so it helps us a little bit.

L7-cue_138
00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:41.326
(Actually, some of these so—called particles last such a short time

L7-cue_139
00:11:41.326 --> 00:11:45.316
that there are debates whether it’s in fact possible to define their very existence

L7-cue_140
00:11:45.316 --> 00:11:48.706
to whether it’s a particle or not, but I won’t enter into that debate.)

L7-cue_141
00:11:48.706 --> 00:11:56.056
#In order to illustrate the family idea, I take the two—part cases of a neutron and a proton.

L7-cue_142
00:11:56.056 --> 00:12:02.506
The neutron and the proton have the same mass within a tenth of a percent or so: one is 1836;

L7-cue_143
00:12:02.506 --> 00:12:06.936
the other is 1839 times as heavy as an electron—roughly, if I remember the numbers.

L7-cue_144
00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:10.756
But the thing that’s very remarkable is this:

L7-cue_145
00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:14.416
that for the nuclear forces (which are the strong forces inside the nucleus),

L7-cue_146
00:12:14.416 --> 00:12:18.346
the force between a pair of protons—two protons—is the same as between a proton

L7-cue_147
00:12:18.346 --> 00:12:21.476
and a neutron, and is the same again between a neutron and a neutron.

L7-cue_148
00:12:21.476 --> 00:12:26.966
In other words, for the strong nuclear forces, you can’t tell a proton from a neutron.

L7-cue_149
00:12:26.966 --> 00:12:31.706
#Or, a symmetry law: neutrons may be substituted for protons

L7-cue_150
00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:36.236
without changing anything—provided you’re only talking about the strong forces.

L7-cue_151
00:12:36.236 --> 00:12:39.846
If you’re talking about electrical forces, oh, no: if you change a neutron

L7-cue_152
00:12:39.846 --> 00:12:43.686
for a proton you have a terrible difference, because the proton carries electrical charge

L7-cue_153
00:12:43.686 --> 00:12:46.746
and a neutron doesn’t, so by electrical measurement immediately you can see the

L7-cue_154
00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.796
difference between a proton and a neutron.

L7-cue_155
00:12:48.796 --> 00:12:51.556
#So this symmetry that you can replace neutrons

L7-cue_156
00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:56.606
by protons is what we call an approximate symmetry: it’s right for the strong interactions

L7-cue_157
00:12:56.606 --> 00:13:01.066
and nuclear forces, but it’s not right, in some deep sense of nature,

L7-cue_158
00:13:01.066 --> 00:13:02.646
because it doesn’t work for the electricity.

L7-cue_159
00:13:02.646 --> 00:13:07.056
This is called a partial symmetry, and we have to struggle with these partial symmetries.

L7-cue_160
00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:11.136
#Now, the families have been extended: it turns out that the substitution neutron—

L7-cue_161
00:13:11.136 --> 00:13:14.006
proton can be extended to substitution over a wider range

L7-cue_162
00:13:14.006 --> 00:13:17.436
of particles, but the accuracy is still lower.

L7-cue_163
00:13:17.436 --> 00:13:21.536
You see that neutrons can always be substituted for protons is only approximate;

L7-cue_164
00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:24.676
it’s not true for electricity, and that the widest substitutions

L7-cue_165
00:13:24.676 --> 00:13:30.836
that have been discovered are legitimate is still more poor—a very poor symmetry,

L7-cue_166
00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:32.346
not very accurate.

L7-cue_167
00:13:32.346 --> 00:13:37.956
#But they have helped to gather the particles into families, and thus to locate places

L7-cue_168
00:13:37.956 --> 00:13:41.996
where particles are missing, and to help to discover new ones.

L7-cue_169
00:13:41.996 --> 00:13:47.476
This kind of game, of roughly guessing at family relations, and so on,

L7-cue_170
00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:51.086
is illustrative of the kind of preliminary sparring which one does

L7-cue_171
00:13:51.086 --> 00:13:55.616
with nature before really discovering some deep and fundamental law,

L7-cue_172
00:13:55.616 --> 00:13:56.986
before you get to deeper discoveries.

L7-cue_173
00:13:56.986 --> 00:14:00.346
#Examples are very important in the previous history of science.

L7-cue_174
00:14:00.346 --> 00:14:04.446
For instance, Mendeleyev’s discovery for the periodic table for the elements is analogous

L7-cue_175
00:14:04.446 --> 00:14:09.866
to this game: it is the first step, but the complete description of the reason

L7-cue_176
00:14:09.866 --> 00:14:13.296
for the periodic table came much later, with atomic theory.

L7-cue_177
00:14:13.296 --> 00:14:19.056
#In the same way, organization of the knowledge of nuclear levels and characteristics was made

L7-cue_178
00:14:19.056 --> 00:14:25.566
by Maria Mayer and Jensen, in what they called the shell model of nuclei, some years ago.

L7-cue_179
00:14:25.566 --> 00:14:28.976
And it’s an analogous game, in which a reduction

L7-cue_180
00:14:28.976 --> 00:14:32.766
of the complexity is made by some proximate guesses.

L7-cue_181
00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:36.666
That’s the way it stands today.

L7-cue_182
00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:40.166
#In addition to these things, then we have all these principles that we were talking

L7-cue_183
00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:46.836
about before: principle of relativity; that things must behave quantum mechanically,

L7-cue_184
00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:52.446
and—combining that with the relativity—that all conservation laws must be local.

L7-cue_185
00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:55.876
And so when we put all these principles together,

L7-cue_186
00:14:55.876 --> 00:15:00.506
we discover there are too many—they’re inconsistent with each other.

L7-cue_187
00:15:00.506 --> 00:15:05.246
It seems as if—if we add quantum mechanics plus relativity plus the proposition

L7-cue_188
00:15:05.246 --> 00:15:10.486
that everything has to be local, plus a number of tacit assumptions which we can’t really find

L7-cue_189
00:15:10.486 --> 00:15:13.986
out because we’re prejudiced; we don’t see what they are, and it’s hard to say what they are—

L7-cue_190
00:15:13.986 --> 00:15:18.146
adding it all together we get inconsistency, because we really get infinity

L7-cue_191
00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:20.246
for various things when we calculate them.

L7-cue_192
00:15:20.246 --> 00:15:23.776
#Well, if we get infinity, how will we ever agree that this agrees with nature?

L7-cue_193
00:15:23.776 --> 00:15:28.446
It turns out that it’s possible to sweep the infinities under the rug

L7-cue_194
00:15:28.446 --> 00:15:34.176
by a certain crude skill, and temporarily we’re able to keep on calculating.

L7-cue_195
00:15:34.176 --> 00:15:38.676
But the fact of the matter is, that all the principles that I told you up until now,

L7-cue_196
00:15:38.676 --> 00:15:44.966
if put together, plus some tacit assumptions that we don’t know, gives trouble:

L7-cue_197
00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:48.436
they cannot [be] mutually consistent—nice problem.

L7-cue_198
00:15:48.436 --> 00:15:53.826
#An example of the tacit assumptions that we don’t know what the significance is,

L7-cue_199
00:15:53.826 --> 00:15:57.136
is such proposition as the following: if you calculate the chance

L7-cue_200
00:15:57.136 --> 00:16:01.016
for every possibility-there’s 50 percent probability this will happen,

L7-cue_201
00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:03.746
25 percent that will happen—it should add up to one;

L7-cue_202
00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:07.406
we think that if you add all alternatives you should get 100 percent probability.

L7-cue_203
00:16:07.406 --> 00:16:13.356
#That seems reasonable, but reasonable things are where the trouble always is.

L7-cue_204
00:16:13.356 --> 00:16:14.946
#Another proposition is that the energy

L7-cue_205
00:16:14.946 --> 00:16:19.316
of something must always be positive; it can’t be negative.

L7-cue_206
00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:21.356
Another proposition that is probably added

L7-cue_207
00:16:21.356 --> 00:16:25.746
in in order—before we get inconsistency—is what’s called causality, which is something

L7-cue_208
00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:30.006
like the idea that effects cannot precede their causes.

L7-cue_209
00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:35.626
#Actually, no one has made a model in which you disregard the proposition about the probability,

L7-cue_210
00:16:35.626 --> 00:16:38.866
or you disregard the causality, which is also consistent

L7-cue_211
00:16:38.866 --> 00:16:41.356
with quantum mechanics, relativity, locality and so on.

L7-cue_212
00:16:41.356 --> 00:16:44.596
We really do not know exactly what it is we’re assuming

L7-cue_213
00:16:44.596 --> 00:16:49.606
that gives us the infinite—the difficulty producing infinities.

L7-cue_214
00:16:49.606 --> 00:16:51.546
#Okay, now that’s the present situation.

L7-cue_215
00:16:51.546 --> 00:16:55.606
Now, I’m going to discuss how we would look for a new law.

L7-cue_216
00:16:55.606 --> 00:16:58.186
In general, we look for a new law by the following process.

L7-cue_217
00:16:58.186 --> 00:17:01.026
#First, we guess it.

L7-cue_218
00:17:01.026 --> 00:17:03.696
Then we-don’t laugh, that’s really true.

L7-cue_219
00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:10.406
Then we compute the consequences of the guess to see if this is right—if this law

L7-cue_220
00:17:10.406 --> 00:17:13.396
that we guessed is right—we see what it would imply.

L7-cue_221
00:17:13.396 --> 00:17:20.416
And then we compare those computation results to nature—or, we say compare to experiment

L7-cue_222
00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:27.876
or experience—compare it directly with observation to see if it works.

L7-cue_223
00:17:27.876 --> 00:17:36.666
#If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong.

L7-cue_224
00:17:36.666 --> 00:17:40.586
#In that simple statement, is the key to science:

L7-cue_225
00:17:40.586 --> 00:17:42.776
it doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is;

L7-cue_226
00:17:42.776 --> 00:17:45.316
it doesn’t make any difference how smart you are, who made the guess,

L7-cue_227
00:17:45.316 --> 00:17:48.846
or what his name is-if it disagrees with experiment,

L7-cue_228
00:17:48.846 --> 00:17:52.736
it’s wrong; that’s all there is to it.

L7-cue_229
00:17:52.736 --> 00:17:56.976
#It’s true, however, that one has to check a little bit to make sure that it’s wrong,

L7-cue_230
00:17:56.976 --> 00:18:00.956
because someone who did the experiment may have reported incorrectly,

L7-cue_231
00:18:00.956 --> 00:18:04.336
or there may have been some feature in the experiment that wasn’t noticed,

L7-cue_232
00:18:04.336 --> 00:18:07.426
like some kind of dirt and so on—you have to obviously check.

L7-cue_233
00:18:07.426 --> 00:18:10.756
#Furthermore, the man who computed the consequences—[it] even may have been the same

L7-cue_234
00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:13.666
man that made the guesses—may have made some mistake in the analysis.

L7-cue_235
00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:15.486
Those are obvious remarks.

L7-cue_236
00:18:15.486 --> 00:18:19.036
#So when I say, if it disagrees with experiment it’s wrong, I mean,

L7-cue_237
00:18:19.036 --> 00:18:21.716
after the experiment has been checked, the calculations have been checked,

L7-cue_238
00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:24.916
and the thing has been rubbed back and forth a few times to make sure

L7-cue_239
00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:29.936
that the consequences are logical consequences from the guess and that, in fact,

L7-cue_240
00:18:29.936 --> 00:18:33.666
it disagrees with a very carefully checked experiment.

L7-cue_241
00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:38.296
#This will give you somewhat a wrong impression of science; it means that we keep

L7-cue_242
00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:41.726
on guessing possibilities and comparing them to experiment,

L7-cue_243
00:18:41.726 --> 00:18:46.506
and this is to put the experiment on, really a little bit weak position.

L7-cue_244
00:18:46.506 --> 00:18:50.466
It turns out that the experimenters have a certain individual character:

L7-cue_245
00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:55.636
they like to do experiments even if nobody’s guessed yet.

L7-cue_246
00:18:55.636 --> 00:18:59.346
#So it’s very often true that experiments in a region

L7-cue_247
00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:04.086
in which people know the theorist doesn’t know anything—nobody’s guessed yet—for instance,

L7-cue_248
00:19:04.086 --> 00:19:06.766
we may have guessed all these laws, but we don’t know whether they really work

L7-cue_249
00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:09.816
at very high energy, because it’s just a good guess that they work at high energy—

L7-cue_250
00:19:09.816 --> 00:19:12.246
so the experimenter says, "Let’s try higher energy"—

L7-cue_251
00:19:12.246 --> 00:19:16.466
and therefore experiment produces trouble every once in a while.

L7-cue_252
00:19:16.466 --> 00:19:20.006
That is, it produces a discovery that one of the things that we thought of is wrong,

L7-cue_253
00:19:20.006 --> 00:19:26.996
so we-what I would say is, experiment can produce unexpected results,

L7-cue_254
00:19:26.996 --> 00:19:29.856
and that starts us guessing again.

L7-cue_255
00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:36.706
#For instance, an unexpected result is the mu meson and its neutrino, which was not guessed

L7-cue_256
00:19:36.706 --> 00:19:44.176
at by anybody whatever before it was discovered, and still nobody has any method of guessing

L7-cue_257
00:19:44.176 --> 00:19:48.706
by which this is a natural thing.

L7-cue_258
00:19:48.706 --> 00:19:52.076
Now, you see of course, that with this method we can disprove any definite theory:

L7-cue_259
00:19:52.076 --> 00:19:56.786
[if] you have a definite theory, a real guess from which you can really compute consequences

L7-cue_260
00:19:56.786 --> 00:20:00.106
which could be compared to experiment, then in principle we can get rid

L7-cue_261
00:20:00.106 --> 00:20:04.256
of any theory-you can always prove any definite theory wrong.

L7-cue_262
00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:06.866
#Notice, however, we never prove it right.

L7-cue_263
00:20:06.866 --> 00:20:10.546
Suppose that you invent a good guess, calculate the consequences,

L7-cue_264
00:20:10.546 --> 00:20:14.076
and discover that every consequence that you calculate agrees with experiment.

L7-cue_265
00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:15.376
Your theory is then right?

L7-cue_266
00:20:15.376 --> 00:20:21.186
#No, it is simply not proved wrong, because in the future there could be a wider range

L7-cue_267
00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:24.416
of experiments, you could compute a wider range of consequences,

L7-cue_268
00:20:24.416 --> 00:20:26.856
and you may discover then that the thing is wrong.

L7-cue_269
00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:31.926
That’s why a laws like Newton’s laws for the motion of planets last such a long time:

L7-cue_270
00:20:31.926 --> 00:20:36.896
he guessed the law of gravitation, calculated all kinds of consequences for the solar system,

L7-cue_271
00:20:36.896 --> 00:20:39.536
and so on, compared them to experiment,

L7-cue_272
00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:41.956
and it took several hundred years before the slight error

L7-cue_273
00:20:41.956 --> 00:20:43.876
of the motion of Mercury was developed.

L7-cue_274
00:20:43.876 --> 00:20:49.196
#During all that time, the theory had been failed to be proved wrong, and could be taken

L7-cue_275
00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:53.226
to be temporarily right-but it can never be proved right,

L7-cue_276
00:20:53.226 --> 00:20:58.596
because tomorrow’s experiment may succeed in proving what you thought was right, wrong.

L7-cue_277
00:20:58.596 --> 00:21:01.726
So we never are right; we can only be sure we’re wrong.

L7-cue_278
00:21:01.726 --> 00:21:06.516
#However, it’s rather remarkable that we can last so long—I mean,

L7-cue_279
00:21:06.516 --> 00:21:11.876
have some idea which will last so long.

L7-cue_280
00:21:11.876 --> 00:21:15.946
Incidentally, some people—one of the ways of stopping the science would be

L7-cue_281
00:21:15.946 --> 00:21:19.876
to only do experiments in the region where you know the laws.

L7-cue_282
00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:24.776
But the experimenters search most diligently, and with the greatest effort,

L7-cue_283
00:21:24.776 --> 00:21:28.946
in exactly those places where it seems most likely that we can prove the theories wrong.

L7-cue_284
00:21:28.946 --> 00:21:32.346
#In other words, we’re trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly possible,

L7-cue_285
00:21:32.346 --> 00:21:35.726
because only in that way do we find progress.

L7-cue_286
00:21:35.726 --> 00:21:41.336
For example, today, among the ordinary low—energy phenomena,

L7-cue_287
00:21:41.336 --> 00:21:44.816
we don’t know where to look for trouble—we think everything’s all right—and

L7-cue_288
00:21:44.816 --> 00:21:48.996
so there isn’t any particular big program looking for trouble

L7-cue_289
00:21:48.996 --> 00:21:52.036
in nuclear reactions or in superconductivity.

L7-cue_290
00:21:52.036 --> 00:21:55.626
#I must say I’m concentrating on discovering fundamental laws: there’s a whole range

L7-cue_291
00:21:55.626 --> 00:21:59.416
of physics which is interesting, and understanding at another level these phenomena

L7-cue_292
00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:03.326
like superconductivity and nuclear reactions, but I’m talking about discovering trouble,

L7-cue_293
00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:05.486
something wrong with the fundamental law.

L7-cue_294
00:22:05.486 --> 00:22:09.916
#Nobody knows where to look there; therefore, all the experiments today are—in this field

L7-cue_295
00:22:09.916 --> 00:22:13.706
of finding out the new law—are at high energy.

L7-cue_296
00:22:13.706 --> 00:22:19.316
#I must also point out to you that you cannot prove a vague theory wrong.

L7-cue_297
00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:24.216
If the guess that you make is poorly expressed and rather vague, and the method that you use

L7-cue_298
00:22:24.216 --> 00:22:28.686
for figuring out the consequences is rather a little vague—you’re not sure, and you just say,

L7-cue_299
00:22:28.686 --> 00:22:32.696
"I think everything’s because it’s all due to moogles, and moogles do this and that,

L7-cue_300
00:22:32.696 --> 00:22:37.216
more or less, so I can sort of explain how this works"— then you see that that theory is "good"

L7-cue_301
00:22:37.216 --> 00:22:38.916
because it can’t be proved wrong.

L7-cue_302
00:22:38.916 --> 00:22:45.246
#If the process of computing the consequences is indefinite,

L7-cue_303
00:22:45.246 --> 00:22:47.976
then with a little skill any experimental result can be made

L7-cue_304
00:22:47.976 --> 00:22:50.846
to look like an expected consequence.

L7-cue_305
00:22:50.846 --> 00:22:52.626
You’re probably familiar with that in other fields.

L7-cue_306
00:22:52.626 --> 00:22:55.766
#For example, A hates his mother.

L7-cue_307
00:22:55.766 --> 00:22:58.206
The reason is, of course, because she didn’t caress him

L7-cue_308
00:22:58.206 --> 00:23:01.066
or love him enough when he was a child.

L7-cue_309
00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:03.836
Actually, if you investigate, you find out that as a matter of fact,

L7-cue_310
00:23:03.836 --> 00:23:06.396
she did love him very much, and everything was all right.

L7-cue_311
00:23:06.396 --> 00:23:10.336
#Well, then it’s because she was overindulgent when he was young.

L7-cue_312
00:23:10.336 --> 00:23:14.146
So by having a vague theory, it’s possible to get either result.

L7-cue_313
00:23:14.146 --> 00:23:22.506
#Now wait, now the cure for this one is the following: it would be possible to say,

L7-cue_314
00:23:22.506 --> 00:23:26.876
if it were possible to state ahead of time, how much love is not enough,

L7-cue_315
00:23:26.876 --> 00:23:32.106
and how much love is overindulgent exactly, then there would be a perfectly legitimate theory

L7-cue_316
00:23:32.106 --> 00:23:33.786
against which you can make tests.

L7-cue_317
00:23:33.786 --> 00:23:37.846
It is usually said, when this is pointed out, how much love is, and so on, "Oh,

L7-cue_318
00:23:37.846 --> 00:23:41.466
you’re dealing with psychological matters, where things can’t be defined so precisely!"

L7-cue_319
00:23:41.466 --> 00:23:49.556
Yes, but then you can’t claim to know anything about it.

L7-cue_320
00:23:49.556 --> 00:23:55.876
#Now, we have examples, you’ll be horrified to hear, in physics of exactly the same kind.

L7-cue_321
00:23:55.876 --> 00:23:59.656
We have these approximate symmetries; [it] works something like this:

L7-cue_322
00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:04.996
you have approximate symmetry, you suppose it’s perfect—calculate the consequences (it’s easy

L7-cue_323
00:24:04.996 --> 00:24:06.946
if you suppose it’s perfect)—and compare with experiment.

L7-cue_324
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:09.296
Of course, it doesn’t agree—because, of course,

L7-cue_325
00:24:09.296 --> 00:24:13.116
the symmetry you’re supposed to expect is approximate.

L7-cue_326
00:24:13.116 --> 00:24:15.956
So if the agreement is pretty good, you say, "Nice!"

L7-cue_327
00:24:15.956 --> 00:24:18.746
If the agreement is very poor, you say,

L7-cue_328
00:24:18.746 --> 00:24:24.126
"Well this particular thing must be especially sensitive to the failure of the symmetry."

L7-cue_329
00:24:24.126 --> 00:24:29.326
#Now, you laugh, but we had to make progress in that way: in the beginning,

L7-cue_330
00:24:29.326 --> 00:24:32.216
when the subject is first new, and these particles are new

L7-cue_331
00:24:32.216 --> 00:24:37.236
to us—this jockeying around—this is a feeling way of guessing at the result.

L7-cue_332
00:24:37.236 --> 00:24:39.436
And this is the beginning of any science.

L7-cue_333
00:24:39.436 --> 00:24:45.826
#The same thing is true of psychology as it is of the symmetry propositions in the physics.

L7-cue_334
00:24:45.826 --> 00:24:51.086
So don’t laugh too hard; it’s necessary in the very beginning to be very careful.

L7-cue_335
00:24:51.086 --> 00:24:57.576
It’s easy to fall over the deep end by this kind of vague theory: it’s hard to prove it wrong;

L7-cue_336
00:24:57.576 --> 00:25:02.076
it takes a certain skill and experience to not walk off the plank on the game.

L7-cue_337
00:25:02.076 --> 00:25:06.706
In this process, of guessing—computing consequences,

L7-cue_338
00:25:06.706 --> 00:25:11.206
and comparing to experiment—we can get stuck at various stages.

L7-cue_339
00:25:11.206 --> 00:25:17.066
#For example, we may, in the guess stage, get stuck: we have no ideas; we can’t guess an idea.

L7-cue_340
00:25:17.066 --> 00:25:19.226
Or we may get in the computing stage stuck.

L7-cue_341
00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:24.326
For example, Yukawa guessed an idea for the nuclear forces in 1934,

L7-cue_342
00:25:24.326 --> 00:25:28.706
[but] nobody could compute the consequences because the mathematics was too difficult.

L7-cue_343
00:25:28.706 --> 00:25:31.556
Therefore, they couldn’t compare it with experiments successfully,

L7-cue_344
00:25:31.556 --> 00:25:36.426
and the theory has remained, for a long time—until we discovered all his junk,

L7-cue_345
00:25:36.426 --> 00:25:42.156
and this junk was not contemplated by Yukawa, and therefore it’s undoubtedly not as simple,

L7-cue_346
00:25:42.156 --> 00:25:43.836
at least, as the way Yukawa did it.

L7-cue_347
00:25:43.836 --> 00:25:46.876
#Another place you can get stuck is at the experimental end.

L7-cue_348
00:25:46.876 --> 00:25:51.676
For example, the quantum theory of gravitation is very—going very slowly,

L7-cue_349
00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:54.796
if at all—because there’s no use: all the experiments

L7-cue_350
00:25:54.796 --> 00:26:00.136
that you can do are—never involve quantum mechanics and gravitation at the same time,

L7-cue_351
00:26:00.136 --> 00:26:04.336
because the gravity force is so weak compared to electrical forces.

L7-cue_352
00:26:04.336 --> 00:26:09.486
#Now, I want to concentrate from now on, because I’m a theoretical physicist—I’m more delighted

L7-cue_353
00:26:09.486 --> 00:26:13.766
with this end of the problem, as to what goes—how do you make the guesses.

L7-cue_354
00:26:13.766 --> 00:26:19.136
Now it’s strictly, as I said before, not of any importance where the guess comes from;

L7-cue_355
00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:21.486
it’s only important that it should agree with experiment,

L7-cue_356
00:26:21.486 --> 00:26:24.986
and that it should be as definite as possible.

L7-cue_357
00:26:24.986 --> 00:26:28.646
#But you say, "Then it’s very simple: we set up a machine, a great computing machine,

L7-cue_358
00:26:28.646 --> 00:26:31.376
which has a random wheel in it that makes a succession of guesses.

L7-cue_359
00:26:31.376 --> 00:26:34.106
Each time it guesses a hypothesis about how nature should work,

L7-cue_360
00:26:34.106 --> 00:26:37.246
[it] computes immediately the consequences and makes a comparison to a list

L7-cue_361
00:26:37.246 --> 00:26:39.506
of experimental results it has at the other end."

L7-cue_362
00:26:39.506 --> 00:26:42.496
In other words, guessing is a dumb man’s job.

L7-cue_363
00:26:42.496 --> 00:26:50.256
#Actually, it’s quite the opposite, and I will try to explain why.

L7-cue_364
00:26:50.256 --> 00:26:52.426
The first problem is how to start.

L7-cue_365
00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:55.296
You say, "I’ll start with all the known principles."

L7-cue_366
00:26:55.296 --> 00:26:57.576
But the principles that are all known are inconsistent

L7-cue_367
00:26:57.576 --> 00:27:00.566
with each other, so something has to be removed.

L7-cue_368
00:27:00.566 --> 00:27:04.686
So we get a lot of letters from people—we’re always getting letters from people

L7-cue_369
00:27:04.686 --> 00:27:08.996
who are insisting that we ought to make holes in our guesses as follows—you see,

L7-cue_370
00:27:08.996 --> 00:27:13.386
you make a hole to make room for a new guess: somebody says, "Do you know,

L7-cue_371
00:27:13.386 --> 00:27:16.056
you people always say space is continuous, but how do you know,

L7-cue_372
00:27:16.056 --> 00:27:19.486
when you get to a small enough dimension, that there really are enough points

L7-cue_373
00:27:19.486 --> 00:27:23.626
in between-[that] it isn’t just a lot of dots separated by little distances?"

L7-cue_374
00:27:23.626 --> 00:27:27.276
#Or they say, "You know those quantum mechanical amplitudes you just told me about,

L7-cue_375
00:27:27.276 --> 00:27:30.676
they’re so complicated and absurd, what makes you think those are right?

L7-cue_376
00:27:30.676 --> 00:27:32.626
Maybe they aren’t right."

L7-cue_377
00:27:32.626 --> 00:27:37.546
I get a lot of letters with such content, but I must say that such remarks are perfectly obvious

L7-cue_378
00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:40.606
and are perfectly clear to anybody who’s working on this problem,

L7-cue_379
00:27:40.606 --> 00:27:42.426
and it doesn’t do any good to point this out.

L7-cue_380
00:27:42.426 --> 00:27:45.086
#The problem is, not what might be wrong,

L7-cue_381
00:27:45.086 --> 00:27:47.916
but what might be substituted precisely in place of it.

L7-cue_382
00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:53.256
If you say anything precise—for example, in the case of a continuous space,

L7-cue_383
00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:58.276
suppose the precise proposition is that space really consists of a series of dots only,

L7-cue_384
00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:00.446
and the space between them doesn’t mean anything,

L7-cue_385
00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:03.556
and the dots are in a cubic array—then we can prove

L7-cue_386
00:28:03.556 --> 00:28:06.646
that immediately is wrong; that doesn’t work.

L7-cue_387
00:28:06.646 --> 00:28:10.076
#You see, the problem is not to make, to change, or to say something might be wrong,

L7-cue_388
00:28:10.076 --> 00:28:13.406
but to replace it by something—and that is not so easy.

L7-cue_389
00:28:13.406 --> 00:28:16.526
As soon as any real definite idea is substituted,

L7-cue_390
00:28:16.526 --> 00:28:20.736
it becomes almost immediately apparent that it doesn’t work.

L7-cue_391
00:28:20.736 --> 00:28:27.746
#Secondly, there’s an infinite number of possibilities of these simple types.

L7-cue_392
00:28:27.746 --> 00:28:31.156
It’s something like this: you’re sitting working very hard, you’ve worked for a long time trying

L7-cue_393
00:28:31.156 --> 00:28:35.946
to open a safe, and some Joe comes along who doesn’t know anything about what you’re doing,

L7-cue_394
00:28:35.946 --> 00:28:38.326
or anything, except that you’re trying to open a safe; he says,

L7-cue_395
00:28:38.326 --> 00:28:42.296
"Why don’t you try the combination 10-20-30?"

L7-cue_396
00:28:42.296 --> 00:28:46.986
Because you’re busy: you tried a lot of things; maybe you already tried 10-20-30;

L7-cue_397
00:28:46.986 --> 00:28:51.686
maybe you know that the middle number is already 32 and not 20; maybe you know that,

L7-cue_398
00:28:51.686 --> 00:28:56.086
as a matter of fact, this is a five digit combination that we have.

L7-cue_399
00:28:56.086 --> 00:29:00.826
#So these letters don’t do any good, and so please don’t send me any letters trying

L7-cue_400
00:29:00.826 --> 00:29:04.026
to tell me how the thing is going to work.

L7-cue_401
00:29:04.026 --> 00:29:11.616
I read them to make sure that I haven’t already thought of that, but it takes too long

L7-cue_402
00:29:11.616 --> 00:29:16.246
to answer them because they’re usually in the class "Try 10- 20-30."

L7-cue_403
00:29:16.246 --> 00:29:20.236
And as usual, nature’s imagination far surpasses our own.

L7-cue_404
00:29:20.236 --> 00:29:24.686
#As we’ve seen from the other theories, they are really quite subtle and deep—and to get

L7-cue_405
00:29:24.686 --> 00:29:28.666
such a subtle and deep guess is not so easy; one must be really clever to guess,

L7-cue_406
00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:31.186
and it’s not possible to do it blindly by machine.

L7-cue_407
00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:38.096
#So I want to discuss the art of guessing nature’s laws; it’s an art.

L7-cue_408
00:29:38.096 --> 00:29:40.006
How is it done?

L7-cue_409
00:29:40.006 --> 00:29:44.126
One way, you might think, "Well, look at history: how did the other guys do it?"

L7-cue_410
00:29:44.126 --> 00:29:48.056
Or look at history, you first start out with Newton: he [was] in a situation

L7-cue_411
00:29:48.056 --> 00:29:54.646
where he had incomplete knowledge, and he was able to get the laws by putting together ideas

L7-cue_412
00:29:54.646 --> 00:29:58.446
which all were relatively close to experiment—there wasn’t a great distance

L7-cue_413
00:29:58.446 --> 00:30:00.596
between the observations and the test.

L7-cue_414
00:30:00.596 --> 00:30:03.356
#Now, that’s the first one, but now it doesn’t work so good.

L7-cue_415
00:30:03.356 --> 00:30:06.956
Now, the next guy who did something—another man who did something great—was Maxwell,

L7-cue_416
00:30:06.956 --> 00:30:08.886
who obtained the laws of electricity and magnetism.

L7-cue_417
00:30:08.886 --> 00:30:15.486
But what he did was this, he put together all the laws of electricity due to Faraday

L7-cue_418
00:30:15.486 --> 00:30:18.476
and other people that came before him, and he looked at them and he realized

L7-cue_419
00:30:18.476 --> 00:30:21.606
that they were mutually inconsistent; they were mathematically inconsistent.

L7-cue_420
00:30:21.606 --> 00:30:25.436
In order to straighten it out he had to add one term to an equation.

L7-cue_421
00:30:25.436 --> 00:30:28.446
#By the way, he did this by inventing a model for himself

L7-cue_422
00:30:28.446 --> 00:30:32.766
of idler wheels, and gears, and so on, in space.

L7-cue_423
00:30:32.766 --> 00:30:37.886
Then he found what the new law was, and nobody paid much attention,

L7-cue_424
00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:39.516
because they didn’t believe in the idler wheels.

L7-cue_425
00:30:39.516 --> 00:30:45.756
We don’t believe in the idler wheels today, but the equations that he obtained were correct.

L7-cue_426
00:30:45.756 --> 00:30:48.706
So the logic may be wrong, but the answer is all right.

L7-cue_427
00:30:48.706 --> 00:30:52.376
#In the case of relativity, the discovery of relativity was completely different:

L7-cue_428
00:30:52.376 --> 00:30:57.426
there was an accumulation of paradoxes; the known laws gave inconsistent results,

L7-cue_429
00:30:57.426 --> 00:31:00.546
and it was a new kind of thinking, a thinking in terms

L7-cue_430
00:31:00.546 --> 00:31:03.986
of discussing the possible symmetries of laws.

L7-cue_431
00:31:03.986 --> 00:31:08.626
It was especially difficult because it was for the first time realized how long something

L7-cue_432
00:31:08.626 --> 00:31:12.786
like Newton’s laws could be right—and still ultimately be wrong—and, second,

L7-cue_433
00:31:12.786 --> 00:31:18.116
that ordinary ideas of time and space that seem so instinctive could be wrong.

L7-cue_434
00:31:18.116 --> 00:31:23.216
#Quantum mechanics was discovered in two independent ways, which is a lesson.

L7-cue_435
00:31:23.216 --> 00:31:25.766
There, again, and even more so, an enormous number

L7-cue_436
00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:30.396
of paradoxes were discovered experimentally, things that absolutely couldn’t be explained

L7-cue_437
00:31:30.396 --> 00:31:35.116
in any way by what was known—not that the knowledge was incomplete,

L7-cue_438
00:31:35.116 --> 00:31:40.336
but the knowledge was too complete!: your prediction was, this should happen; it didn’t.

L7-cue_439
00:31:40.336 --> 00:31:44.296
#The two different routes were: one, by Schrodinger, who guessed the equations; another,

L7-cue_440
00:31:44.296 --> 00:31:47.736
by Heisenberg, who argued that you must analyze what’s measurable.

L7-cue_441
00:31:47.736 --> 00:31:53.706
So two different philosophical methods reduced to the same discovery in the end.

L7-cue_442
00:31:53.706 --> 00:31:57.046
#More recently, the discovery of the laws of this [weak decay] interaction,

L7-cue_443
00:31:57.046 --> 00:32:00.836
which are still only partly known, add quite a somewhat different situation:

L7-cue_444
00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:06.756
this time it was a case of incomplete knowledge, and only the equation was guessed.

L7-cue_445
00:32:06.756 --> 00:32:08.986
The special difficulty this time was

L7-cue_446
00:32:08.986 --> 00:32:13.076
that the experiments were all wrong—all the experiments were wrong.

L7-cue_447
00:32:13.076 --> 00:32:16.506
#Now, how can you guess the right answer when, when you calculate the results it disagrees

L7-cue_448
00:32:16.506 --> 00:32:20.506
with the experiment, and you have the courage to say the experiments must be wrong.

L7-cue_449
00:32:20.506 --> 00:32:24.636
I’ll explain where the courage comes from in a minute.

L7-cue_450
00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:28.916
#Now, today, we haven’t any paradoxes—maybe.

L7-cue_451
00:32:28.916 --> 00:32:31.446
We have this infinity that comes if we put all the laws together,

L7-cue_452
00:32:31.446 --> 00:32:35.986
but the rug—sweeping people are so—sweeping the dirt under the rug—are so clever

L7-cue_453
00:32:35.986 --> 00:32:38.956
that one sometimes thinks that’s not a serious paradox.

L7-cue_454
00:32:38.956 --> 00:32:43.156
The fact that there are all these particles doesn’t tell us anything except

L7-cue_455
00:32:43.156 --> 00:32:45.406
that our knowledge is incomplete.

L7-cue_456
00:32:45.406 --> 00:32:48.836
#Now, I’m sure that history does not repeat itself in physics, as you see from this list,

L7-cue_457
00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:54.216
and the reason is this: any scheme—like, "Think of symmetry laws," or "Put the equations

L7-cue_458
00:32:54.216 --> 00:33:01.516
in mathematical form," or any of these schemes "Guess equations," and so on—are known

L7-cue_459
00:33:01.516 --> 00:33:04.976
to everybody now, and they’re tried all the time.

L7-cue_460
00:33:04.976 --> 00:33:07.946
So if the place where you get stuck is not that—and you try that right away:

L7-cue_461
00:33:07.946 --> 00:33:11.336
we try looking for symmetries; we try all the things that have been tried before,

L7-cue_462
00:33:11.336 --> 00:33:14.776
but we’re stuck-so it must be another way next time.

L7-cue_463
00:33:14.776 --> 00:33:21.246
#Each time that we get in this log jam of too many problems, it’s because the methods

L7-cue_464
00:33:21.246 --> 00:33:23.436
that we’re using are just like the ones we used before.

L7-cue_465
00:33:23.436 --> 00:33:28.096
We try all that right away, but the new discovery is going to be made

L7-cue_466
00:33:28.096 --> 00:33:35.096
in a completely different way—so history doesn’t help us very much.

L7-cue_467
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:42.036
#I’d like to talk about—a little bit about this—Heisenberg’s idea that you shouldn’t talk

L7-cue_468
00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:44.626
about what you can’t measure, because a lot of people talk about that

L7-cue_469
00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:46.416
without understanding it very well.

L7-cue_470
00:33:46.416 --> 00:33:49.756
They say in physics you shouldn’t talk about what you can’t measure.

L7-cue_471
00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:54.646
If what you mean by this, if you interpret this in the sense that the constructs or inventions

L7-cue_472
00:33:54.646 --> 00:33:59.296
that you make, that you talk about, must be of such a kind that the consequences

L7-cue_473
00:33:59.296 --> 00:34:03.376
that you compute must be comparable to experiment—that is,

L7-cue_474
00:34:03.376 --> 00:34:07.636
if you don’t compute a consequence like "A moo must be three goos,"

L7-cue_475
00:34:07.636 --> 00:34:10.696
when nobody knows what a moo and a goo is (that’s no good);

L7-cue_476
00:34:10.696 --> 00:34:16.356
if the consequences can be compared to experiment—then that’s all that’s necessary.

L7-cue_477
00:34:16.356 --> 00:34:23.306
#It is not necessary that moos and goos can’t appear in the guess: that’s perfectly all right:

L7-cue_478
00:34:23.306 --> 00:34:25.766
you can have as much junk in the guess as you want,

L7-cue_479
00:34:25.766 --> 00:34:27.626
provided that you can compare it to experiment.

L7-cue_480
00:34:27.626 --> 00:34:32.906
That’s not fully appreciated, because it’s usually said—people usually complain

L7-cue_481
00:34:32.906 --> 00:34:36.936
of the unwarranted extension of the ideas of particles and paths

L7-cue_482
00:34:36.936 --> 00:34:40.226
and so forth into the atomic realm.

L7-cue_483
00:34:40.226 --> 00:34:43.756
#Not so at all—there’s nothing unwarranted about the extension.

L7-cue_484
00:34:43.756 --> 00:34:46.006
We must, and we should, and we always do,

L7-cue_485
00:34:46.006 --> 00:34:50.436
extend—as far as we can beyond what we already know—those things,

L7-cue_486
00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:54.936
those ideas that we’ve already obtained; we extend the ideas beyond their range.

L7-cue_487
00:34:54.936 --> 00:34:59.486
Dangerous, yes—uncertain, yes—but the only way to make progress.

L7-cue_488
00:34:59.486 --> 00:35:03.776
It’s necessary; it makes science useful, although it’s uncertain.

L7-cue_489
00:35:03.776 --> 00:35:05.666
It’s only useful if it makes predictions.

L7-cue_490
00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:09.566
It’s only useful if it tells you about some experiment that hasn’t been done;

L7-cue_491
00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:12.286
it’s no good if it just tells you what just went on.

L7-cue_492
00:35:12.286 --> 00:35:16.546
So it’s necessary to extend the ideas beyond where they’ve been tested.

L7-cue_493
00:35:16.546 --> 00:35:21.226
#For example, in the law of gravitation, which was developed to understand the motion

L7-cue_494
00:35:21.226 --> 00:35:26.586
of planets, if Newton simply said, "I now understand the planets," and didn’t try

L7-cue_495
00:35:26.586 --> 00:35:30.796
to compare it to the earth’s pull, and didn’t—we can’t—if we’re not allowed to say,

L7-cue_496
00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:36.766
"Maybe what holds the galaxies together is gravitation; we must try that."

L7-cue_497
00:35:36.766 --> 00:35:39.726
It’s no good to say, "Well, when you get to the size of galaxies,

L7-cue_498
00:35:39.726 --> 00:35:41.936
since you don’t know anything about it, anything can happen."

L7-cue_499
00:35:41.936 --> 00:35:42.946
Yes, I know.

L7-cue_500
00:35:42.946 --> 00:35:46.136
#But there’s no science in it; there’s no understanding, ultimately, of the galaxies.

L7-cue_501
00:35:46.136 --> 00:35:54.426
If, on the other hand, you assume that the entire behavior is due to only known laws,

L7-cue_502
00:35:54.426 --> 00:35:59.726
this assumption is very limited, and very definite, and easily broken by experiment.

L7-cue_503
00:35:59.726 --> 00:36:00.736
#What we’re looking for is just

L7-cue_504
00:36:00.736 --> 00:36:05.066
such hypotheses—very definite, easy to compare to experiment.

L7-cue_505
00:36:05.066 --> 00:36:13.136
#The fact is, that the way the galaxies behave so far doesn’t seem to be against the proposition.

L7-cue_506
00:36:13.136 --> 00:36:17.506
It would be easily disproved if it were false, but it’s very useful to make the hypothesis.

L7-cue_507
00:36:17.506 --> 00:36:21.556
#I’ll give another example even more interesting and important.

L7-cue_508
00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:25.786
Probably the most powerful assumption in all of biology, the single assumption

L7-cue_509
00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:29.156
that makes the progress of biology the greatest,

L7-cue_510
00:36:29.156 --> 00:36:34.116
is the assumption that everything the animals do, the atoms can do—or,

L7-cue_511
00:36:34.116 --> 00:36:38.316
that the things that are seen in the biological world are the results of the behavior

L7-cue_512
00:36:38.316 --> 00:36:42.076
of physical and chemical phenomena with no extra something.

L7-cue_513
00:36:42.076 --> 00:36:45.596
#You could always say, "When we come to living things, anything can happen."

L7-cue_514
00:36:45.596 --> 00:36:47.686
If you do that you never understand a living thing.

L7-cue_515
00:36:47.686 --> 00:36:53.696
#It’s very hard to believe that the wiggling of the tentacle of the octopus is nothing

L7-cue_516
00:36:53.696 --> 00:36:58.206
but some fooling around of atoms according the known physical laws.

L7-cue_517
00:36:58.206 --> 00:37:03.486
But if investigated with this hypothesis, one is able to make guesses quite accurately

L7-cue_518
00:37:03.486 --> 00:37:07.116
as to how it works, and one makes great progress in understanding the thing.

L7-cue_519
00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:11.216
So far, it hasn’t been—the tentacle hasn’t been cut off.

L7-cue_520
00:37:11.216 --> 00:37:15.996
What I mean is, there hasn’t been found that this idea is wrong.

L7-cue_521
00:37:15.996 --> 00:37:20.356
#It’s therefore not unscientific to take a guess, although many people

L7-cue_522
00:37:20.356 --> 00:37:22.316
who are not in science think it is.

L7-cue_523
00:37:22.316 --> 00:37:25.336
For instance, I had a conversation about flying saucers some years ago

L7-cue_524
00:37:25.336 --> 00:37:31.366
with laymen-because I’m scientific, I know all about flying saucers.

L7-cue_525
00:37:31.366 --> 00:37:36.216
I said I don’t think there are flying saucers.

L7-cue_526
00:37:36.216 --> 00:37:40.276
My antagonist said, "Is it impossible that there are flying saucers?

L7-cue_527
00:37:40.276 --> 00:37:42.136
Can you prove that it’s impossible?"

L7-cue_528
00:37:42.136 --> 00:37:46.256
No, I can’t prove it’s impossible; it’s just very unlikely.

L7-cue_529
00:37:46.256 --> 00:37:50.656
"That," they say, "[shows] you are very unscientific: if you can’t prove it impossible,

L7-cue_530
00:37:50.656 --> 00:37:52.756
then how can you say that it’s unlikely?"

L7-cue_531
00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:57.446
Well, that’s the way-that is scientific: it is scientific only to say what’s more likely

L7-cue_532
00:37:57.446 --> 00:38:01.476
and less likely, and not to be proving all the time possible and impossible.

L7-cue_533
00:38:01.476 --> 00:38:06.106
#To define what I mean, I finally said to him, "Listen: I mean that from my knowledge

L7-cue_534
00:38:06.106 --> 00:38:11.866
of the world that I see around me, I think that it is much more likely that the reports

L7-cue_535
00:38:11.866 --> 00:38:16.696
of flying saucers are the result of the known irrational characteristics

L7-cue_536
00:38:16.696 --> 00:38:20.776
of terrestrial intelligence, rather than the unknown rational efforts

L7-cue_537
00:38:20.776 --> 00:38:24.056
of extraterrestrial intelligence!"

L7-cue_538
00:38:24.056 --> 00:38:27.166
It’s just more likely, that’s all—and it’s a good guess.

L7-cue_539
00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:30.836
#We always try to guess the most likely explanation, keeping in the back

L7-cue_540
00:38:30.836 --> 00:38:36.066
of the mind the fact that if it doesn’t work, then we must discuss the other possibilities.

L7-cue_541
00:38:36.066 --> 00:38:43.536
#Now, how to guess at what to keep and what to throw away.

L7-cue_542
00:38:43.536 --> 00:38:47.626
You see, we have all these nice principles, and known facts, and so on, but we’re in some kind

L7-cue_543
00:38:47.626 --> 00:38:51.366
of trouble that we get the infinities, or we don’t get enough of a description;

L7-cue_544
00:38:51.366 --> 00:38:55.056
we’re missing some parts, and sometimes that means that we have probably

L7-cue_545
00:38:55.056 --> 00:38:57.826
to throw away some idea—at least in the past it’s always turned

L7-cue_546
00:38:57.826 --> 00:39:02.666
out that some deeply held idea has to be thrown away, and the question is what to throw away,

L7-cue_547
00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:06.776
and what to keep: if you throw it all away, it’s going a little far,

L7-cue_548
00:39:06.776 --> 00:39:08.326
and you don’t got much to work with.

L7-cue_549
00:39:08.326 --> 00:39:10.916
After all, the conservation of energy looks good, and it’s nice;

L7-cue_550
00:39:10.916 --> 00:39:13.306
I don’t want to throw it away, and so on.

L7-cue_551
00:39:13.306 --> 00:39:18.336
To guess what to keep and what to throw away takes considerable skill.

L7-cue_552
00:39:18.336 --> 00:39:20.436
(Actually, it probably is merely a matter of luck,

L7-cue_553
00:39:20.436 --> 00:39:23.606
but it looks like it takes considerable skill.)

L7-cue_554
00:39:23.606 --> 00:39:27.866
#For instance, probability amplitudes are very strange, and the first thing you’d think is

L7-cue_555
00:39:27.866 --> 00:39:30.856
that the strange new ideas are clearly cockeyed.

L7-cue_556
00:39:30.856 --> 00:39:34.436
Yet, everything that could be deduced from the ideas of the existence

L7-cue_557
00:39:34.436 --> 00:39:39.176
of quantum mechanical probability amplitudes—strange though they are—all the

L7-cue_558
00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:44.416
things that depend on that work throughout all these strange particles, work 100 percent.

L7-cue_559
00:39:44.416 --> 00:39:46.476
Everything that depends on that seems to work.

L7-cue_560
00:39:46.476 --> 00:39:51.846
So I don’t believe that that idea is wrong; and that when we find out what the inner guts

L7-cue_561
00:39:51.846 --> 00:39:55.586
of this stuff is, we’ll find that idea is wrong; I think that part’s right.

L7-cue_562
00:39:55.586 --> 00:39:59.756
#I’m only guessing; I’m telling you how I guess.

L7-cue_563
00:39:59.756 --> 00:40:06.226
For instance, that space is continuous is, I believe, wrong.

L7-cue_564
00:40:06.226 --> 00:40:11.036
Because we get these infinities and other difficulties, they—and we have some questions

L7-cue_565
00:40:11.036 --> 00:40:16.686
as to what determines the sizes of all these particles—I rather suspect that the simple ideas

L7-cue_566
00:40:16.686 --> 00:40:20.796
of geometry extended down into infinitely small space is wrong.

L7-cue_567
00:40:20.796 --> 00:40:24.866
I don’t believe that space—I mean, I’m making a hole; I’m only making a guess.

L7-cue_568
00:40:24.866 --> 00:40:26.136
I’m not telling you what to substitute.

L7-cue_569
00:40:26.136 --> 00:40:32.306
If I did, I would finish this lecture with a known law, of course.

L7-cue_570
00:40:32.306 --> 00:40:37.586
#Some people have used the inconsistency of all the principles to say

L7-cue_571
00:40:37.586 --> 00:40:42.406
that there’s only one possible consistent world, that if we put all the principles together

L7-cue_572
00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:46.246
and calculate very exactly, we will not only be able to reuse the principles,

L7-cue_573
00:40:46.246 --> 00:40:50.466
but discover that these are the only things that can exist, and have the thing consistent.

L7-cue_574
00:40:50.466 --> 00:40:51.996
#That seems to me like a big order.

L7-cue_575
00:40:51.996 --> 00:40:56.516
#I don’t believe-that sounds like wagging the tail by the dog.

L7-cue_576
00:40:56.516 --> 00:40:57.996
That’s right.

L7-cue_577
00:40:57.996 --> 00:41:01.456
[I mean] wagging the dog by the tail.

L7-cue_578
00:41:01.456 --> 00:41:05.406
I believe that you have to be given that certain things exist, a few of them:

L7-cue_579
00:41:05.406 --> 00:41:08.666
not all the 48 particles, or the 50—some—odd particles;

L7-cue_580
00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:13.226
a few little principles-a few little things exist, like electron and something—something,

L7-cue_581
00:41:13.226 --> 00:41:17.326
is given, and then with all the principles, the great complexities that come

L7-cue_582
00:41:17.326 --> 00:41:22.086
out with probably a definite consequence—but I don’t think you can get the whole thing

L7-cue_583
00:41:22.086 --> 00:41:25.096
from just arguments about consistency.

L7-cue_584
00:41:25.096 --> 00:41:27.846
#Finally, we have another problem, which is the question

L7-cue_585
00:41:27.846 --> 00:41:31.766
of the meaning of the partial symmetries.

L7-cue_586
00:41:31.766 --> 00:41:40.576
I think I’d better leave that one go because of a shortage of time.

L7-cue_587
00:41:40.576 --> 00:41:43.446
#Well, I’ll say it quickly.

L7-cue_588
00:41:43.446 --> 00:41:46.146
These symmetries-like the neutron and proton, are nearly the same

L7-cue_589
00:41:46.146 --> 00:41:48.166
but they’re not, for electricity.

L7-cue_590
00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:50.856
or that the law of reflection symmetry is perfect except

L7-cue_591
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:54.896
for one kind of a reaction—are very annoying.

L7-cue_592
00:41:54.896 --> 00:41:57.136
The thing is almost symmetrical, but not.

L7-cue_593
00:41:57.136 --> 00:42:02.026
#Now, two schools of thought exist: one will say, "It’s really simple; they’re really symmetrical,

L7-cue_594
00:42:02.026 --> 00:42:04.986
but there’s a little complication which knocks it a little bit cockeyed."

L7-cue_595
00:42:04.986 --> 00:42:09.946
Then there’s another school of thought, which has only one representative—myself—which says,

L7-cue_596
00:42:09.946 --> 00:42:16.306
"No, the thing may be complicated, and become simple only through the complications."

L7-cue_597
00:42:16.306 --> 00:42:20.086
Like this: the Greeks believed that the orbits of the planets were circles.

L7-cue_598
00:42:20.086 --> 00:42:25.416
The orbits of the planets are nearly circles; actually, they’re ellipses.

L7-cue_599
00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:29.426
#The next question is, well, they’re not quite symmetrical, but they’re almost circles;

L7-cue_600
00:42:29.426 --> 00:42:32.836
they’re very close to circles—why are they very close to circles?

L7-cue_601
00:42:32.836 --> 00:42:34.306
Why are they nearly symmetrical?

L7-cue_602
00:42:34.306 --> 00:42:38.746
Because of the long complicated effects of tidal friction, a very complicated idea.

L7-cue_603
00:42:38.746 --> 00:42:43.716
So it is possible that nature in our heart is completely—is unsymmetrical for these things,

L7-cue_604
00:42:43.716 --> 00:42:47.796
but in the complexities of reality it gets approximately looking

L7-cue_605
00:42:47.796 --> 00:42:51.036
as if its symmetrical—the ellipses look almost like circles.

L7-cue_606
00:42:51.036 --> 00:42:51.896
#That’s another possibility.

L7-cue_607
00:42:51.896 --> 00:42:56.276
Nobody knows; it’s just guesswork.

L7-cue_608
00:42:56.276 --> 00:43:03.156
#Now, another thing that people often say is, that for guessing, two identical theories,

L7-cue_609
00:43:03.156 --> 00:43:07.266
two theories-suppose you have two theories, A and B,

L7-cue_610
00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:09.836
which look completely different psychologically—they have different ideas

L7-cue_611
00:43:09.836 --> 00:43:14.686
in them, and so on—but that all the consequences that are computed, all the consequences

L7-cue_612
00:43:14.686 --> 00:43:17.376
that are computed are exactly the same.

L7-cue_613
00:43:17.376 --> 00:43:20.216
([You] may even say they even agree with experiment.)

L7-cue_614
00:43:20.216 --> 00:43:22.956
#The point is, though, that the two theories, although they sound different

L7-cue_615
00:43:22.956 --> 00:43:25.166
at the beginning, have all consequences the same.

L7-cue_616
00:43:25.166 --> 00:43:27.816
(It’s easy, usually, to prove that mathematically,

L7-cue_617
00:43:27.816 --> 00:43:31.006
by doing a little mathematics ahead of time to show that the logic from this one

L7-cue_618
00:43:31.006 --> 00:43:34.206
and this one will always give corresponding consequences.)

L7-cue_619
00:43:34.206 --> 00:43:38.166
#Suppose we have two such theories: how are we going to decide which one is right?

L7-cue_620
00:43:38.166 --> 00:43:42.596
No way-not by science, because they both agree with experiment to the same extent,

L7-cue_621
00:43:42.596 --> 00:43:44.976
there’s no way to distinguish one from the other.

L7-cue_622
00:43:44.976 --> 00:43:49.656
So two theories, although they may have deeply different ideas behind them,

L7-cue_623
00:43:49.656 --> 00:43:53.166
may be mathematically identical.

L7-cue_624
00:43:53.166 --> 00:43:56.906
#Usually people say, then, in science we should say, one doesn’t know how

L7-cue_625
00:43:56.906 --> 00:43:58.476
to distinguish them, and that’s right.

L7-cue_626
00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:03.876
#However, for psychological reasons, in order to guess new theories,

L7-cue_627
00:44:03.876 --> 00:44:06.476
these two things are very far from equivalent.

L7-cue_628
00:44:06.476 --> 00:44:09.796
Because one gives a man different ideas than the other.

L7-cue_629
00:44:09.796 --> 00:44:12.966
By putting the theory in a certain kind of framework, you get an idea what

L7-cue_630
00:44:12.966 --> 00:44:17.646
to change—which will be something—for instance, in theory A it talks about something;

L7-cue_631
00:44:17.646 --> 00:44:19.786
then you say, I’ll change that idea in here.

L7-cue_632
00:44:19.786 --> 00:44:22.896
#But to find out what the corresponding thing is you’re going to change in here,

L7-cue_633
00:44:22.896 --> 00:44:26.016
may be very complicated—it may not be a simple idea.

L7-cue_634
00:44:26.016 --> 00:44:29.926
In other words, a simple change here may be a very different theory

L7-cue_635
00:44:29.926 --> 00:44:31.726
than a simple change there.

L7-cue_636
00:44:31.726 --> 00:44:35.636
#In other words, although, they’re identical before they’re changed, there are certain ways

L7-cue_637
00:44:35.636 --> 00:44:38.956
of changing one which look natural, which don’t look natural in the other.

L7-cue_638
00:44:38.956 --> 00:44:42.356
Therefore, psychologically we must keep all the theories in our head.

L7-cue_639
00:44:42.356 --> 00:44:45.806
Every theoretical physicist that’s any good knows six

L7-cue_640
00:44:45.806 --> 00:44:49.866
or seven different theoretical representations for exactly the same physics,

L7-cue_641
00:44:49.866 --> 00:44:55.566
and knows that they’re all equivalent, and that nobody is ever going to be able to decide

L7-cue_642
00:44:55.566 --> 00:44:58.586
which one is right at that level, but he keeps them in his head,

L7-cue_643
00:44:58.586 --> 00:45:02.346
hoping that they’ll give him different ideas for guessing.

L7-cue_644
00:45:02.346 --> 00:45:06.736
#Incidentally, that reminds me of another thing: that is, that the philosophy,

L7-cue_645
00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:14.436
or the ideas around the theory, a lot of ideas—you say, "I believe there is a spacetime"

L7-cue_646
00:45:14.436 --> 00:45:20.776
or something like that in order to discuss your analysis—that these ideas change enormously

L7-cue_647
00:45:20.776 --> 00:45:23.026
when there are very tiny changes in the theory.

L7-cue_648
00:45:23.026 --> 00:45:25.916
In other words, for instance, Newton’s ideas about space

L7-cue_649
00:45:25.916 --> 00:45:29.276
and time agreed with experiment very well.

L7-cue_650
00:45:29.276 --> 00:45:34.336
#But in order to get the correct motion of the orbit of Mercury, which was a tiny,

L7-cue_651
00:45:34.336 --> 00:45:37.856
tiny difference, the difference in the character of the theory

L7-cue_652
00:45:37.856 --> 00:45:39.446
with which you started was enormous.

L7-cue_653
00:45:39.446 --> 00:45:43.986
The reason is, these are so simple and so perfect, they produce definite results.

L7-cue_654
00:45:43.986 --> 00:45:46.196
In order to get something that produces a little different result,

L7-cue_655
00:45:46.196 --> 00:45:49.646
it has to be completely different—you can’t make imperfections on a perfect thing;

L7-cue_656
00:45:49.646 --> 00:45:52.246
you have to have another perfect thing.

L7-cue_657
00:45:52.246 --> 00:45:56.256
#The philosophical ideas between Newton’s theory of gravitation and Einstein’s theory

L7-cue_658
00:45:56.256 --> 00:46:00.556
of gravitation are enormous—their differences, rather, are enormous.

L7-cue_659
00:46:00.556 --> 00:46:02.076
#What are these philosophies?

L7-cue_660
00:46:02.076 --> 00:46:05.996
#These philosophies are really tricky ways to compute consequences quickly:

L7-cue_661
00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:10.476
a philosophy—which is sometimes called an understanding of the law—is simply a way

L7-cue_662
00:46:10.476 --> 00:46:15.776
that a person holds the laws in his mind so as to guess quickly at consequences.

L7-cue_663
00:46:15.776 --> 00:46:19.376
Some people have said, and it’s true for instance, in the case of Maxwell’s equations

L7-cue_664
00:46:19.376 --> 00:46:22.806
and other equations, never mind the philosophy, never mind anything

L7-cue_665
00:46:22.806 --> 00:46:25.656
of this kind, just guess the equations.

L7-cue_666
00:46:25.656 --> 00:46:29.336
#The problem is only to compute the answer so they agree with experiment,

L7-cue_667
00:46:29.336 --> 00:46:34.056
and it’s not necessary to have a philosophy, or words about the equation.

L7-cue_668
00:46:34.056 --> 00:46:39.266
That’s true, in a sense, yes—and no: it’s good in the sense you may be,

L7-cue_669
00:46:39.266 --> 00:46:43.246
if you only guess the equation, you’re not prejudicing yourself, and you’ll guess better.

L7-cue_670
00:46:43.246 --> 00:46:46.356
On the other hand, maybe the philosophy maybe helped you to guess; it’s very hard to say.

L7-cue_671
00:46:46.356 --> 00:46:51.096
#For those people who insist, however, that the only thing that’s important is

L7-cue_672
00:46:51.096 --> 00:46:56.316
that the theory agrees with experiment, I would like to make an imaginary discussion

L7-cue_673
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:59.266
between a Mayan astronomer and his student.

L7-cue_674
00:46:59.266 --> 00:47:04.626
The Maya were able to calculate, with great precision, the predictions, for example,

L7-cue_675
00:47:04.626 --> 00:47:09.126
for eclipses and the position of the moon in the sky, and the position of Venus, and so on.

L7-cue_676
00:47:09.126 --> 00:47:12.246
However, it was all done by arithmetic: you count to certain numbers,

L7-cue_677
00:47:12.246 --> 00:47:17.696
you subtract some numbers, and so on—there was no discussion of what the moon was;

L7-cue_678
00:47:17.696 --> 00:47:20.506
there wasn’t even a discussion of the idea that it went around.

L7-cue_679
00:47:20.506 --> 00:47:23.796
There was only "Calculate the time when there would be an eclipse," or "the time

L7-cue_680
00:47:23.796 --> 00:47:27.156
when it would rise [as a] full moon," and "when it would rise [as a] half moon,"

L7-cue_681
00:47:27.156 --> 00:47:29.706
and so on-just calculating, only.

L7-cue_682
00:47:29.706 --> 00:47:34.736
#Suppose that a young man went to the astronomer and said, "I have an idea:

L7-cue_683
00:47:34.736 --> 00:47:39.756
maybe those things are going around, and there are balls of rocks, like rocks, out there,

L7-cue_684
00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:42.156
we could calculate how they move in a completely different way,

L7-cue_685
00:47:42.156 --> 00:47:47.906
and just calculate what time they appear in the sky," and so on.

L7-cue_686
00:47:47.906 --> 00:47:53.516
#Of course, the Mayan astronomer would say, "Yes, how accurate can you predict eclipses?"

L7-cue_687
00:47:53.516 --> 00:47:56.006
He says, "I haven’t developed the thing very far."

L7-cue_688
00:47:56.006 --> 00:47:59.386
"But we can calculate eclipses more accurately than you can with your model,

L7-cue_689
00:47:59.386 --> 00:48:02.836
and so you must not pay any attention to this, because the mathematical scheme is better."

L7-cue_690
00:48:02.836 --> 00:48:06.736
#There’s a very strong tendency of people to say against some idea,

L7-cue_691
00:48:06.736 --> 00:48:10.616
if someone comes up with an idea that says, "Let’s suppose the world is this way,"

L7-cue_692
00:48:10.616 --> 00:48:15.456
and you say to him, "Well, what would you get for the answer for such—and—such a problem?"

L7-cue_693
00:48:15.456 --> 00:48:17.546
He says, "I haven’t developed it far enough."

L7-cue_694
00:48:17.546 --> 00:48:20.036
And you say, "Well, we have already developed it much further;

L7-cue_695
00:48:20.036 --> 00:48:23.376
we can get the answers very accurately."

L7-cue_696
00:48:23.376 --> 00:48:32.456
#So it is a problem as to whether or not to worry about philosophies behind ideas.

L7-cue_697
00:48:32.456 --> 00:48:39.246
Another thing, of course, that one can use to guess, is to guess new principles.

L7-cue_698
00:48:39.246 --> 00:48:43.366
For instance, in Einstein’s gravitation he guessed, on top of all the other principles,

L7-cue_699
00:48:43.366 --> 00:48:46.376
the principle that corresponded to the idea

L7-cue_700
00:48:46.376 --> 00:48:48.826
that the forces are always proportional to the masses.

L7-cue_701
00:48:48.826 --> 00:48:52.896
He guessed the principle that if you are in an accelerating car,

L7-cue_702
00:48:52.896 --> 00:48:56.776
you couldn’t tell that from being in a gravitational field—and by adding that principle

L7-cue_703
00:48:56.776 --> 00:49:01.526
to all the other principles, [he] was able to deduce the correct laws of gravitation.

L7-cue_704
00:49:01.526 --> 00:49:05.956
#Well, that outlines a number of possible ways of guessing.

L7-cue_705
00:49:05.956 --> 00:49:10.346
#I would now like to come to some other points about the final result.

L7-cue_706
00:49:10.346 --> 00:49:13.536
#First of all, when we’re all finished, and we have a mathematical theory

L7-cue_707
00:49:13.536 --> 00:49:16.926
by which we can compute consequences, it really is an amazing thing.

L7-cue_708
00:49:16.926 --> 00:49:18.226
#What do we do?

L7-cue_709
00:49:18.226 --> 00:49:22.416
#In order to figure out what an atom’s gonna do in a given situation, we make up a whole lot

L7-cue_710
00:49:22.416 --> 00:49:27.206
of rules, with marks on paper, carry them into a machine, which opens and closes switches

L7-cue_711
00:49:27.206 --> 00:49:31.676
in some complicated way, and the result will tell us what the atom is going to do.

L7-cue_712
00:49:31.676 --> 00:49:34.736
Now, if the way that these switches opens and close was some kind of a model

L7-cue_713
00:49:34.736 --> 00:49:39.136
of the atom—in other words, if we thought the atom had such switches in it—then I would say,

L7-cue_714
00:49:39.136 --> 00:49:41.496
"Well, I understand, more or less, what’s going on."

L7-cue_715
00:49:41.496 --> 00:49:46.996
#But I find it quite amazing that it’s possible to predict what will happen

L7-cue_716
00:49:46.996 --> 00:49:49.926
by what we call mathematics: we’re just simply following a whole lot of rules

L7-cue_717
00:49:49.926 --> 00:49:54.156
which have nothing to do, really, with what’s going on in the original thing.

L7-cue_718
00:49:54.156 --> 00:49:58.756
So, in other words, the closing and opening of switches in a computer is quite different,

L7-cue_719
00:49:58.756 --> 00:50:04.826
I think, than what’s happening in nature, and that to me is very surprising.

L7-cue_720
00:50:04.826 --> 00:50:12.016
#Now, finally, there is-I would like to say, one of the most important things

L7-cue_721
00:50:12.016 --> 00:50:15.116
in this guess / compute consequences / compare experiment business,

L7-cue_722
00:50:15.116 --> 00:50:17.096
is to know when you’re right.

L7-cue_723
00:50:17.096 --> 00:50:21.396
#It is possible to know when you’re right way ahead of computing all the consequence—I mean,

L7-cue_724
00:50:21.396 --> 00:50:23.186
of checking of all the consequences.

L7-cue_725
00:50:23.186 --> 00:50:27.276
You can recognize truth by a beauty and simplicity.

L7-cue_726
00:50:27.276 --> 00:50:31.016
It’s always easy, when you’ve got the right guess and make two or three little calculations

L7-cue_727
00:50:31.016 --> 00:50:34.106
to make sure it isn’t obviously wrong, to know that it’s right.

L7-cue_728
00:50:34.106 --> 00:50:38.686
When you get it right, it’s obvious that it’s right—at least if you have any experience.

L7-cue_729
00:50:38.686 --> 00:50:42.406
Because what happens is, that more comes out than goes in: that your guess is,

L7-cue_730
00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:44.236
in fact, that something is very simple.

L7-cue_731
00:50:44.236 --> 00:50:47.906
#And at the moment you guess that it’s simpler than you thought,

L7-cue_732
00:50:47.906 --> 00:50:52.376
then it turns out that it’s right, if it can’t be immediately disproved.

L7-cue_733
00:50:52.376 --> 00:50:55.176
Doesn’t [it] sound silly: I mean, if you can’t see immediately that it’s wrong,

L7-cue_734
00:50:55.176 --> 00:50:58.626
and it’s simpler than it was before, then it’s right.

L7-cue_735
00:50:58.626 --> 00:51:04.876
#The inexperienced, and crackpots, and people like that, who make guesses that are simple,

L7-cue_736
00:51:04.876 --> 00:51:08.176
all right, but you can immediately see that they’re wrong—that doesn’t count.

L7-cue_737
00:51:08.176 --> 00:51:13.546
And others—the inexperienced students— make guesses that are very complicated,

L7-cue_738
00:51:13.546 --> 00:51:17.716
and it sort of looks like it’s all right, but I know it’s not true,

L7-cue_739
00:51:17.716 --> 00:51:21.886
because the truth always turns out to be simpler than you thought.

L7-cue_740
00:51:21.886 --> 00:51:26.236
#What we need is imagination, but imagination in a terrible straightjacket.

L7-cue_741
00:51:26.236 --> 00:51:32.686
We have to find a new view of the world that has to agree with everything that’s known,

L7-cue_742
00:51:32.686 --> 00:51:37.146
but disagree in its predictions somewhere—otherwise it’s not interesting—and

L7-cue_743
00:51:37.146 --> 00:51:38.796
in that disagreement, agree with nature.

L7-cue_744
00:51:38.796 --> 00:51:43.076
#If you can find any other view of the world which agrees over the entire range

L7-cue_745
00:51:43.076 --> 00:51:46.566
where things have already been observed, but disagrees somewhere else,

L7-cue_746
00:51:46.566 --> 00:51:48.726
you’ve made a great discovery, even if it doesn’t agree with nature.

L7-cue_747
00:51:48.726 --> 00:51:56.996
#It’s darn hard, it’s almost impossible—not quite impossible—to find another theory which agrees

L7-cue_748
00:51:56.996 --> 00:52:01.156
with experiments over the entire range in which the old theories have been checked,

L7-cue_749
00:52:01.156 --> 00:52:04.806
and yet gives a different consequences in some other range.

L7-cue_750
00:52:04.806 --> 00:52:10.226
In other words, a new idea is extremely difficult—it takes a fantastic imagination.

L7-cue_751
00:52:10.226 --> 00:52:15.046
#What of the future of this adventure?

L7-cue_752
00:52:15.046 --> 00:52:16.356
What will happen, ultimately?

L7-cue_753
00:52:16.356 --> 00:52:20.006
#We are going along, guessing the laws, how many laws are we going to have to guess?

L7-cue_754
00:52:20.006 --> 00:52:21.846
I don’t know.

L7-cue_755
00:52:21.846 --> 00:52:27.986
#Some of my—let’s say, some of my colleagues—say, well, science will go on.

L7-cue_756
00:52:27.986 --> 00:52:31.856
But certainly there will not be perpetual novelty, say, for 1,000 years.

L7-cue_757
00:52:31.856 --> 00:52:36.276
This thing can’t keep on going: we’re always going to discover new laws, new laws, new laws;

L7-cue_758
00:52:36.276 --> 00:52:40.676
if we do, it’ll get boring that there are so many levels, one underneath the other.

L7-cue_759
00:52:40.676 --> 00:52:45.266
So the only way that it seems to me that it can happen, that what can happen in the future, is,

L7-cue_760
00:52:45.266 --> 00:52:50.066
first: either that everything becomes known, that all the laws become known—that would mean

L7-cue_761
00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:53.716
that after you had enough laws you could compute consequences, and they would always agree

L7-cue_762
00:52:53.716 --> 00:52:58.276
with experiment, which would be the end of the line—or it might happen

L7-cue_763
00:52:58.276 --> 00:53:01.926
that the experiments get harder and harder to make, more and more expensive,

L7-cue_764
00:53:01.926 --> 00:53:06.236
that you get 99.9% of the phenomena but there’s always some phenomenon

L7-cue_765
00:53:06.236 --> 00:53:10.566
which has just been discovered that’s very hard to measure, which disagrees, and gets harder

L7-cue_766
00:53:10.566 --> 00:53:13.506
and harder to measure—as you discover the explanation of that one,

L7-cue_767
00:53:13.506 --> 00:53:16.086
there’s always another one, and it gets slower and slower,

L7-cue_768
00:53:16.086 --> 00:53:20.986
and more and more uninteresting—that’s another way that it can end,

L7-cue_769
00:53:20.986 --> 00:53:23.796
but I think it has to end in one way or another.

L7-cue_770
00:53:23.796 --> 00:53:29.726
#I think that we are very lucky to live in an age in which we’re still making the discoveries.

L7-cue_771
00:53:29.726 --> 00:53:31.306
It’s an age which will never come again.

L7-cue_772
00:53:31.306 --> 00:53:37.036
It’s like the discoveries of America—you only discover it once.

L7-cue_773
00:53:37.036 --> 00:53:40.566
It was an exciting day when there was investigations of America.

L7-cue_774
00:53:40.566 --> 00:53:47.796
#But the age that we live in is the age in which are discovering the fundamental laws of nature,

L7-cue_775
00:53:47.796 --> 00:53:50.966
and that day will never come again.

L7-cue_776
00:53:50.966 --> 00:53:57.246
#I don’t mean we’re finished; I mean we’re right in the process of making such discoveries.

L7-cue_777
00:53:57.246 --> 00:53:59.666
It’s very exciting, marvelous.

L7-cue_778
00:53:59.666 --> 00:54:03.806
But this excitement will have to go.

L7-cue_779
00:54:03.806 --> 00:54:07.556
#Of course, in the future, there will be other interests: there will be interests

L7-cue_780
00:54:07.556 --> 00:54:12.836
of the connection of one level of phenomena to another—phenomena in biology,

L7-cue_781
00:54:12.836 --> 00:54:15.856
and so on-all kinds of things; or, if you’re talking about explorations,

L7-cue_782
00:54:15.856 --> 00:54:18.546
exploring planets, and other things.

L7-cue_783
00:54:18.546 --> 00:54:20.626
But there will not still be the same thing

L7-cue_784
00:54:20.626 --> 00:54:23.186
as we’re doing now-it will just be different interests.

L7-cue_785
00:54:23.186 --> 00:54:29.016
Another thing that will happen is, that if all is known, ultimately,

L7-cue_786
00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:33.926
if it turns out all is known, or it gets very dull, the vigorous philosophy,

L7-cue_787
00:54:33.926 --> 00:54:36.186
and the careful attention to all these things

L7-cue_788
00:54:36.186 --> 00:54:38.356
that I’ve been talking about, will gradually disappear.

L7-cue_789
00:54:38.356 --> 00:54:44.286
#The philosophers, who were always on the outside making stupid remarks, will be able to close in,

L7-cue_790
00:54:44.286 --> 00:54:47.846
because we can’t push them away by saying, "Well, if you were right,

L7-cue_791
00:54:47.846 --> 00:54:49.966
you’d be able to guess all the rest of the laws."

L7-cue_792
00:54:49.966 --> 00:54:52.366
Because when the [laws] are all there, the [philosophers] will have an explanation for it.

L7-cue_793
00:54:52.366 --> 00:54:56.976
For instance, there are always explanations to why the world is three dimensional.

L7-cue_794
00:54:56.976 --> 00:55:01.606
Well, there’s only one world, and it’s hard to tell if that explanation if right or not.

L7-cue_795
00:55:01.606 --> 00:55:06.036
So if everything were known, there will be some explanation about why those are the right laws.

L7-cue_796
00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:10.496
But that explanation will be in a frame that we can’t criticize by arguing that that type

L7-cue_797
00:55:10.496 --> 00:55:13.966
of reasoning will not permit us to go further.

L7-cue_798
00:55:13.966 --> 00:55:19.446
#So there will be a degeneration of ideas, just like the degeneration

L7-cue_799
00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:30.516
that great explorers feel occurs when tourists begin moving in on the territory.

L7-cue_800
00:55:30.516 --> 00:55:39.076
#Now, I must say that in this age, people are experiencing a delight, a tremendous delight,

L7-cue_801
00:55:39.076 --> 00:55:43.356
the delight that you get when you guess how nature will work

L7-cue_802
00:55:43.356 --> 00:55:46.906
in a new situation never seen before.

L7-cue_803
00:55:46.906 --> 00:55:52.916
#From experiments and information in a certain range, you can guess what’s going to happen

L7-cue_804
00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:56.266
in a region where no one has ever explored before.

L7-cue_805
00:55:56.266 --> 00:55:59.976
#It’s a little different than regular exploration—that is, there’s enough clues

L7-cue_806
00:55:59.976 --> 00:56:02.986
on the land discovered to guess what the land is going to look

L7-cue_807
00:56:02.986 --> 00:56:05.456
like that hasn’t been discovered—and these guesses, incidentally,

L7-cue_808
00:56:05.456 --> 00:56:07.496
are often very different than what you’ve already seen.

L7-cue_809
00:56:07.496 --> 00:56:09.136
It takes a lot of thought.

L7-cue_810
00:56:09.136 --> 00:56:16.216
#What is it about nature that lets this happen, that it’s possible to guess

L7-cue_811
00:56:16.216 --> 00:56:19.036
from one part what the rest is going to do?

L7-cue_812
00:56:19.036 --> 00:56:23.236
That’s an unscientific question—what is it about nature—I don’t know how to answer it.

L7-cue_813
00:56:23.236 --> 00:56:26.176
I’m going to give, therefore, an unscientific answer:

L7-cue_814
00:56:26.176 --> 00:56:31.666
#I think it is because nature has a simplicity, and therefore a great beauty.

L7-cue_815
00:56:31.666 --> 00:57:56.000
#Thank you very much.
