##Title Introduction by Provost Dale R. Corson

L1-cue_2
00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:41.686
#Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my privilege to introduce the Messenger Lecturer,

L1-cue_3
00:01:41.686 --> 00:01:46.386
Professor Richard P. Feynman of the California Institute of Technology.

L1-cue_4
00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:52.846
#Professor Feynman is a distinguished theoretical physicist, and he’s done much to bring order

L1-cue_5
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:57.086
out of the confusion which has marked much of the spectacular development

L1-cue_6
00:01:57.086 --> 00:02:00.316
in physics during the post-war period.

L1-cue_7
00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:07.406
Among his honors and awards I will mention only the Albert Einstein award, in 1954.

L1-cue_8
00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.036
This is an award which is made every third year,

L1-cue_9
00:02:10.036 --> 00:02:15.926
and which includes a gold medal and a substantial sum of money.

L1-cue_10
00:02:15.926 --> 00:02:21.676
#Professor Feynman did his undergraduate work at MIT and his graduate work at Princeton.

L1-cue_11
00:02:21.676 --> 00:02:26.416
He worked on the Manhattan Project at Princeton and later at Los Alamos.

L1-cue_12
00:02:26.416 --> 00:02:31.526
He was appointed an assistant professor here at Cornell in 1944,

L1-cue_13
00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:36.256
although he did not assume residence until the end of the war.

L1-cue_14
00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:40.296
#I thought it might be interesting to see what was said about him when he was appointed

L1-cue_15
00:02:40.296 --> 00:02:45.276
at Cornell, so I searched the minutes of our board of trustees—

L1-cue_16
00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:53.456
and there’s absolutely no record of his appointment.

L1-cue_17
00:02:53.456 --> 00:03:02.046
There are, however, some twenty references to leaves of absence, salary, and promotions.

L1-cue_18
00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:08.926
One reference interested me especially: on July 31, 1945 the chairman

L1-cue_19
00:03:08.926 --> 00:03:12.116
of the physics department wrote the dean of the Arts College,

L1-cue_20
00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:17.486
stating that "Dr. Feynman is an outstanding teacher and investigator,

L1-cue_21
00:03:17.486 --> 00:03:30.000
the equal of whom develops infrequently."

L1-cue_22
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.536
The chairman suggested that an annual salary of $3,000 was a bit too low

L1-cue_23
00:03:36.536 --> 00:03:40.000
for a distinguished faculty member,

L1-cue_24
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.866
and recommended that Professor Feynman’s salary be increased $900.

L1-cue_25
00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:58.386
The dean, in an act of unusual generosity and with complete disregard for the solvency

L1-cue_26
00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:05.286
of the university, crossed out the $900 and made it an even $1,000.

L1-cue_27
00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:12.800
You can see that we thought highly of Professor Feynman, even then.

L1-cue_28
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.606
#Feynman took up residence here at the end of 1945

L1-cue_29
00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:20.306
and spent five highly productive years on our faculty.

L1-cue_30
00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:26.016
He left Cornell in 1950 and went to Caltech, where he has been ever since.

L1-cue_31
00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:30.366
#Before I let him talk, I want to tell you just a little bit more about him.

L1-cue_32
00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:35.546
Three or four years ago he started teaching a beginning physics course at Caltech,

L1-cue_33
00:04:35.546 --> 00:04:39.296
and the result has added a new dimension to his fame.

L1-cue_34
00:04:39.296 --> 00:04:43.000
His lectures are now published in two volumes,

L1-cue_35
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.416
and they represent a refreshing approach to the subject.

L1-cue_36
00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:49.936
In the preface of the published lectures,

L1-cue_37
00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:57.496
there’s a picture of Feynman performing happily on the bongo drums.

L1-cue_38
00:04:57.496 --> 00:05:02.926
My Caltech friends tell me that he sometimes drops in on the Los Angeles nightspots and takes

L1-cue_39
00:05:02.926 --> 00:05:09.816
over the work of the drummer, but Professor Feynman tells me that that’s not so.

L1-cue_40
00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:16.000
#Another of his specialties is safecracking.

L1-cue_41
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.886
One legend says that he once opened a locked safe in a secret establishment,

L1-cue_42
00:05:21.886 --> 00:05:30.000
removed a secret document, and left a note saying GUESS WHO.

L1-cue_43
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.516
I could tell you about the time that he learned Spanish before he went to give a series

L1-cue_44
00:05:34.516 --> 00:05:46.806
of lectures in Brazil, but I won’t.

L1-cue_45
00:05:46.806 --> 00:05:52.056
#This gives you enough background, I think, so let me say that I’m delighted

L1-cue_46
00:05:52.056 --> 00:05:59.966
to welcome Professor Feynman back to Cornell; his general topic is the nature of physical law,

L1-cue_47
00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:07.806
and his topic for tonight is The Law of Gravitation— an example of physical law. Professor Feynman.

L1-cue_48
00:06:07.806 --> 00:06:25.000
##Title The Law of Gravitation: an example of physical law

L1-cue_49
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.626
#It’s odd, but in the infrequent occasions when I’ve been called upon

L1-cue_50
00:06:29.626 --> 00:06:34.716
in a formal place to play the bongo drums, the introducer never seems to find it necessary

L1-cue_51
00:06:34.716 --> 00:06:43.000
to mention that I also do theoretical physics.

L1-cue_52
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.736
I believe that’s probably that we respect the arts more than the sciences.

L1-cue_53
00:06:49.736 --> 00:06:57.200
The artists of the Renaissance said that man’s main concern should be for man.

L1-cue_54
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.696
And yet there are some other things of interest in the world:

L1-cue_55
00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:06.456
even the artist appreciates sunsets, and the ocean waves,

L1-cue_56
00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:09.976
and the march of the stars across the heavens.

L1-cue_57
00:07:09.976 --> 00:07:16.000
And there is some reason, then, to talk of other things sometimes.

L1-cue_58
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.246
#As we look into these things, we get an aesthetic pleasure from them directly

L1-cue_59
00:07:21.246 --> 00:07:28.756
on observation, but there’s also a rhythm and a pattern between the phenomena of nature,

L1-cue_60
00:07:28.756 --> 00:07:33.816
which isn’t apparent to the eye, but only to the eye of analysis.

L1-cue_61
00:07:33.816 --> 00:07:38.576
And it’s these rhythms and patterns which we call physical laws.

L1-cue_62
00:07:38.576 --> 00:07:40.116
#What I want to talk about in this series

L1-cue_63
00:07:40.116 --> 00:07:44.696
of lectures is the general characteristics of these physical laws.

L1-cue_64
00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:50.000
That’s even another level, if you will, of higher generality over the laws themselves.

L1-cue_65
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.296
And it’s really (all I am talking about is) nature as seen as a result

L1-cue_66
00:07:56.296 --> 00:08:01.796
of detailed analysis—but only the most overall general qualities

L1-cue_67
00:08:01.796 --> 00:08:04.836
of nature is what I mainly wish to speak about.

L1-cue_68
00:08:04.836 --> 00:08:09.406
#Now, such a topic has a tendency to become too philosophical, because it becomes so general—

L1-cue_69
00:08:09.406 --> 00:08:13.666
that a person talks in such generalities that everybody can understand him—

L1-cue_70
00:08:13.666 --> 00:08:17.506
and it’s considered to be some deep philosophy, if you will.

L1-cue_71
00:08:17.506 --> 00:08:23.166
However, I would like to be rather more special, and I would like to be understood

L1-cue_72
00:08:23.166 --> 00:08:27.876
in an honest way rather than in a vague way to some extent; and so, if you don’t mind,

L1-cue_73
00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:35.316
I am going to try to give—instead of only generalities in this first lecture—

L1-cue_74
00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:40.486
an example of physical law, so that you have at least one example of the things

L1-cue_75
00:08:40.486 --> 00:08:42.636
about which I am speaking generally.

L1-cue_76
00:08:42.636 --> 00:08:48.386
In this way, I can use this example again and again to give an instance to make a reality

L1-cue_77
00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:51.356
out of something which would otherwise be too abstract.

L1-cue_78
00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:56.636
#Now, I’ve chosen for my special example of physical law to tell you about the theory

L1-cue_79
00:08:56.636 --> 00:09:00.516
of gravitation, or the phenomena of gravity.

L1-cue_80
00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:08.000
Why I chose gravity, I don’t know—whatever I chose, you would have asked the same question.

L1-cue_81
00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.666
Actually, it was one of the first great laws to be discovered,

L1-cue_82
00:09:13.666 --> 00:09:16.506
and it has an interesting history.

L1-cue_83
00:09:16.506 --> 00:09:18.146
You might say, "Yes, but then it’s old hat—

L1-cue_84
00:09:18.146 --> 00:09:21.846
I would like to hear something about more modern science."

L1-cue_85
00:09:21.846 --> 00:09:27.016
More recent perhaps, but not more modern: modern science is exactly in the same tradition

L1-cue_86
00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:29.646
as the discoveries of the law of gravitation.

L1-cue_87
00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:32.986
It is only more recent discoveries that we would be talking about.

L1-cue_88
00:09:32.986 --> 00:09:38.716
And so I do not feel at all bad about telling you of the law of gravitation, because I am—

L1-cue_89
00:09:38.716 --> 00:09:43.656
in describing its history and the methods, the character of its discovery and its quality—

L1-cue_90
00:09:43.656 --> 00:09:49.000
talking about modern science, completely modern.

L1-cue_91
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.876
#This law has been called the greatest generalization achieved by the human mind.

L1-cue_92
00:09:54.876 --> 00:09:59.906
And you can get already, from my introduction, that I’m interested not so much

L1-cue_93
00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:05.196
in the human mind as in the marvel of nature, who can obey such an elegant

L1-cue_94
00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:08.106
and simple law as this law of gravitation.

L1-cue_95
00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:14.300
So our main concentration will not be on how clever we are to have found it all out,

L1-cue_96
00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:21.306
but on how clever she is to pay attention to it!

L1-cue_97
00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:26.156
#Now, what is this law of gravitation that we’re going to talk about?

L1-cue_98
00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:33.826
The law is that two bodies—or bodies—exert a force upon each other which is inversely

L1-cue_99
00:10:33.826 --> 00:10:40.426
as the square of the distance between them, and varies directly as the product of their masses.

L1-cue_100
00:10:40.426 --> 00:10:45.616
Mathematically, we can write that great law down in a formula: some kind of a constant,

L1-cue_101
00:10:45.616 --> 00:10:50.296
times the product of the two masses, divided by the square of the distance.

L1-cue_102
00:10:50.296 --> 00:10:57.236
Now, if I add the remark that a body reacts to a force by accelerating,

L1-cue_103
00:10:57.236 --> 00:11:02.736
or by changing its velocity every second to an extent inversely as its mass—

L1-cue_104
00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:08.766
it changes velocity more if the mass is lower, and so on, inversely as the mass—

L1-cue_105
00:11:08.766 --> 00:11:13.266
then I have said everything about the law of gravitation that needs to be said:

L1-cue_106
00:11:13.266 --> 00:11:19.176
everything else is a consequence, a mathematical consequence of those two things that I said.

L1-cue_107
00:11:19.176 --> 00:11:21.726
That’s a remarkable enough phenomenon in itself,

L1-cue_108
00:11:21.726 --> 00:11:26.276
that the next lecture will consider this in more detail.

L1-cue_109
00:11:26.276 --> 00:11:29.376
#Now, I know you’re not all—I know some of you are, but you’re not all—

L1-cue_110
00:11:29.376 --> 00:11:32.296
mathematicians, so you cannot all immediately see all

L1-cue_111
00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:36.186
of the consequences of these two remarks.

L1-cue_112
00:11:36.186 --> 00:11:39.486
And so what I would like to do in this lecture is to briefly tell you the story

L1-cue_113
00:11:39.486 --> 00:11:43.356
of the discovery, tell you what some of the consequences are,

L1-cue_114
00:11:43.356 --> 00:11:47.826
what the effect this discovery had on the history of science, what kinds of mystery

L1-cue_115
00:11:47.826 --> 00:11:52.666
such a law entails, something about the refinements made by Einstein,

L1-cue_116
00:11:52.666 --> 00:11:56.256
and possibly the relation to other laws of physics.

L1-cue_117
00:11:56.256 --> 00:11:58.436
#The history of the thing, briefly, is this:

L1-cue_118
00:11:58.436 --> 00:12:02.996
that the ancients first observed the way the planets seemed to move about in the sky,

L1-cue_119
00:12:02.996 --> 00:12:07.626
and concluded that they all—along with the earth—went around the sun.

L1-cue_120
00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:13.536
This discovery was later made independently by Copernicus, after they had forgotten—

L1-cue_121
00:12:13.536 --> 00:12:17.036
people had forgotten—that it had already been made.

L1-cue_122
00:12:17.036 --> 00:12:25.866
#Now, the next question that came up to study was: exactly how do they go around the sun—

L1-cue_123
00:12:25.866 --> 00:12:30.926
that is, exactly what kind of motion: do they go with the sun at the center of a circle,

L1-cue_124
00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:33.276
or do they go in some other kind of a curve?

L1-cue_125
00:12:33.276 --> 00:12:34.926
How fast do they move?—and so on.

L1-cue_126
00:12:34.926 --> 00:12:39.000
And this discovery took longer to make.

L1-cue_127
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.856
The times after Copernicus were times in which there were great debates—

L1-cue_128
00:12:45.856 --> 00:12:50.866
about whether the planets in fact went around the sun along with the earth,

L1-cue_129
00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:53.786
or whether the earth was at the center of the universe, and so on;

L1-cue_130
00:12:53.786 --> 00:12:56.356
and there were considerable arguments about this—

L1-cue_131
00:12:56.356 --> 00:13:02.796
when a man named Tycho Brahe got an idea of a way of answering the question:

L1-cue_132
00:13:02.796 --> 00:13:07.276
he thought that it might perhaps be a good idea to look very, very carefully,

L1-cue_133
00:13:07.276 --> 00:13:11.636
and to record where the planets actually appear in the sky—

L1-cue_134
00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:16.216
and then the alternative theories might be distinguished from one another.

L1-cue_135
00:13:16.216 --> 00:13:21.806
#This is the key of modern science, and is the beginning of the true understanding of nature:

L1-cue_136
00:13:21.806 --> 00:13:26.276
this idea to look at the thing, to record the details,

L1-cue_137
00:13:26.276 --> 00:13:31.246
and to hope that in the information thus obtained may lie a clue to one or another

L1-cue_138
00:13:31.246 --> 00:13:33.946
of a possible theoretical interpretation.

L1-cue_139
00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:40.916
So Tycho—who was a rich man and owned, I believe, an island near Copenhagen—

L1-cue_140
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:48.000
outfitted his island with great brass circles and special observing positions (situating chairs

L1-cue_141
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.286
that you could look through a little hole) and recorded night

L1-cue_142
00:13:51.286 --> 00:13:54.916
after night the position of the planets.

L1-cue_143
00:13:54.916 --> 00:14:02.736
#It’s only through such hard work that we can find out anything.

L1-cue_144
00:14:02.736 --> 00:14:09.616
When all these data were collected they came into the hands of Kepler,

L1-cue_145
00:14:09.616 --> 00:14:17.046
who then tried to analyze what kinds of motions the planets made around the sun.

L1-cue_146
00:14:17.046 --> 00:14:19.646
He did this by a method of trial and error.

L1-cue_147
00:14:19.646 --> 00:14:24.336
At one stage he thought he had it: he figured out that they went around the sun in circles,

L1-cue_148
00:14:24.336 --> 00:14:27.766
with the sun off center, and noticed that one planet—

L1-cue_149
00:14:27.766 --> 00:14:31.896
I think it was Mars, but I don’t know—was eight minutes of arc off.

L1-cue_150
00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:35.026
He decided that this was too big for Tycho Brahe to have made an error,

L1-cue_151
00:14:35.026 --> 00:14:38.016
and that this was not the right answer.

L1-cue_152
00:14:38.016 --> 00:14:44.296
#So because of the precision of experiments, he was able to proceed and go onto another trial

L1-cue_153
00:14:44.296 --> 00:14:50.026
and found, in fact, ultimately this—three things: first, that the planets went in ellipses

L1-cue_154
00:14:50.026 --> 00:14:52.846
around the sun, with the sun at a focus.

L1-cue_155
00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:57.766
An ellipse is a curve all artists know about, because it’s a foreshortened circle;

L1-cue_156
00:14:57.766 --> 00:15:01.446
children know about it because somebody told them that if you take a string and tie it

L1-cue_157
00:15:01.446 --> 00:15:06.446
to two tacks and put a pencil in there, it’ll make an ellipse.

L1-cue_158
00:15:06.446 --> 00:15:10.946
These two tacks are the foci, and if the sun is here, the shape of the orbit of a planet

L1-cue_159
00:15:10.946 --> 00:15:14.736
around the sun is one of these curves.

L1-cue_160
00:15:14.736 --> 00:15:19.066
#The next question is, in going around the ellipse, how does it go:

L1-cue_161
00:15:19.066 --> 00:15:20.316
does it go faster when it’s near the sun,

L1-cue_162
00:15:20.316 --> 00:15:22.986
and slower when it’s further from the sun?—and so on.

L1-cue_163
00:15:22.986 --> 00:15:28.726
If we take away the other focus, we have the sun, then, and the planet going around.

L1-cue_164
00:15:28.726 --> 00:15:32.056
#Kepler found the answer to this, too.

L1-cue_165
00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:38.776
He found this: that if you put the position of the planet down at two times separated

L1-cue_166
00:15:38.776 --> 00:15:44.276
by some definite time—let’s say three weeks—and then at another place in the orbit,

L1-cue_167
00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:48.356
put the positions of the planets—again separated by three weeks—

L1-cue_168
00:15:48.356 --> 00:15:53.526
and draw lines from the sun to the planet (technically called radius vectors,

L1-cue_169
00:15:53.526 --> 00:16:02.186
but anyway lines from the sun to the planet)—then the area that’s enclosed in the orbit

L1-cue_170
00:16:02.186 --> 00:16:04.046
of the planet and the two lines that are separated

L1-cue_171
00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:07.786
by the planet’s position three weeks apart is the same no matter what part

L1-cue_172
00:16:07.786 --> 00:16:09.486
of the orbit the thing is on.

L1-cue_173
00:16:09.486 --> 00:16:14.396
So that it has to go faster when it’s closer—in order to get the same area as it goes slower

L1-cue_174
00:16:14.396 --> 00:16:18.676
when it’s further away—and in this precise manner.

L1-cue_175
00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:27.626
Some several years later, he found the third rule: that had not to do exactly with the motion

L1-cue_176
00:16:27.626 --> 00:16:32.196
of a single planet around the sun, but related the various planets to each other.

L1-cue_177
00:16:32.196 --> 00:16:40.386
It said that the time that it took the planet to go all the way around was related to the size

L1-cue_178
00:16:40.386 --> 00:16:46.026
of the orbit—that the time went as the square root of the cube of the size of the orbit—

L1-cue_179
00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:48.826
and the size of the orbit is the diameter all the way

L1-cue_180
00:16:48.826 --> 00:16:52.596
across the biggest distance on the ellipse.

L1-cue_181
00:16:52.596 --> 00:16:58.076
#So he has these three laws, which I’ll summarize by saying: it’s an ellipse;

L1-cue_182
00:16:58.076 --> 00:17:05.326
that equal areas are swept in equal times; and that the time to go around varies

L1-cue_183
00:17:05.326 --> 00:17:10.136
as the three-half power of the size—the square root of a cube of the size.

L1-cue_184
00:17:10.136 --> 00:17:15.946
So that’s three laws of Kepler, which is a very complete description

L1-cue_185
00:17:15.946 --> 00:17:22.016
of the motion of the planets around the sun.

L1-cue_186
00:17:22.016 --> 00:17:25.556
#The next question was, what makes them go around?

L1-cue_187
00:17:25.556 --> 00:17:27.916
Or how can we understand this in more detail?

L1-cue_188
00:17:27.916 --> 00:17:29.566
Or is there anything else to say?

L1-cue_189
00:17:29.566 --> 00:17:34.536
In the meantime, Galileo was investigating the laws of motion.

L1-cue_190
00:17:34.536 --> 00:17:40.236
#Incidentally, at the time of Kepler, the problem of what drove the planets

L1-cue_191
00:17:40.236 --> 00:17:44.856
around the sun was answered by some people by saying

L1-cue_192
00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:47.976
that there were angels behind here beating their wings

L1-cue_193
00:17:47.976 --> 00:17:51.936
and pushing the planet along around the orbit.

L1-cue_194
00:17:51.936 --> 00:17:55.626
#As we’ll see, that answer is not very far from the truth: the only difference is

L1-cue_195
00:17:55.626 --> 00:18:07.156
that the angels sit in a different direction, and their wings go this way.

L1-cue_196
00:18:07.156 --> 00:18:12.006
But the point that the angels sit in a different direction is the one that I must now come to.

L1-cue_197
00:18:12.006 --> 00:18:16.286
Galileo—in studying the laws of motion, and doing a number of experiments

L1-cue_198
00:18:16.286 --> 00:18:20.846
such as seeing how balls rolled down incline planes, and how pendulums swung, and so on—

L1-cue_199
00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:26.606
discovered an idealization, a great principle called the principle of inertia, which is this:

L1-cue_200
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:30.076
that if a thing has nothing acting on it—if an object has nothing acting on it—

L1-cue_201
00:18:30.076 --> 00:18:34.366
and it’s going along at a certain velocity in a straight line, it will go at the same velocity

L1-cue_202
00:18:34.366 --> 00:18:37.026
at exactly the same straight line forever.

L1-cue_203
00:18:37.026 --> 00:18:43.906
Unbelievable though that may sound to anybody who has tried to make a ball roll forever,

L1-cue_204
00:18:43.906 --> 00:18:48.966
the idealization is correct: that if there were no influences acting (such as friction

L1-cue_205
00:18:48.966 --> 00:18:52.606
on the floor, and so on), the thing would go at a uniform speed forever.

L1-cue_206
00:18:52.606 --> 00:18:59.886
#The next point was made by Newton, who discussed the next question, which is:

L1-cue_207
00:18:59.886 --> 00:19:04.176
when it doesn’t go in a straight line, then what?

L1-cue_208
00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:10.436
He answered this way: that a force is needed to change the velocity in any manner.

L1-cue_209
00:19:10.436 --> 00:19:15.766
For instance, if you’re pushing it in a direction that it moves, it will speed up;

L1-cue_210
00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:21.216
if you find that it changes direction, then the force must have been sideways.

L1-cue_211
00:19:21.216 --> 00:19:26.276
And that the force can be measured by the product of two effects: first,

L1-cue_212
00:19:26.276 --> 00:19:31.366
how much does the velocity change in a small interval of time?

L1-cue_213
00:19:31.366 --> 00:19:33.026
How fast is the velocity changing?

L1-cue_214
00:19:33.026 --> 00:19:35.366
How much is it accelerating in this direction,

L1-cue_215
00:19:35.366 --> 00:19:38.236
or how much is the velocity changing when it changes direction?

L1-cue_216
00:19:38.236 --> 00:19:39.816
That’s called the acceleration.

L1-cue_217
00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:42.596
When that’s multiplied by a coefficient called the mass

L1-cue_218
00:19:42.596 --> 00:19:47.856
of an object (or its inertia coefficient), then that together is the force.

L1-cue_219
00:19:47.856 --> 00:19:53.106
#For instance, if one has a stone on the end of a string, and swings it in a circle

L1-cue_220
00:19:53.106 --> 00:20:00.356
over one’s head, then one finds that one has to pull; the reason is,

L1-cue_221
00:20:00.356 --> 00:20:05.066
that the speed is not changing as it goes around the circle, but it’s changing its direction

L1-cue_222
00:20:05.066 --> 00:20:11.236
so there must be perpetually an in-pulling force, and this is proportional to the mass.

L1-cue_223
00:20:11.236 --> 00:20:12.926
So that if we were to take two different objects—

L1-cue_224
00:20:12.926 --> 00:20:16.536
first swing one, and then swing another one at the same speed around the head,

L1-cue_225
00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:21.326
and measure the force in the second one—that second one, the new force,

L1-cue_226
00:20:21.326 --> 00:20:24.236
is bigger than the other force in the proportion that the masses are different.

L1-cue_227
00:20:24.236 --> 00:20:32.726
This is a way of measuring the masses, by how hard it is to change the direction.

L1-cue_228
00:20:32.726 --> 00:20:38.346
#Now, then, Newton saw from this that—

L1-cue_229
00:20:38.346 --> 00:20:43.616
for instance, to take a simple example—if a planet is going in a circle around the sun,

L1-cue_230
00:20:43.616 --> 00:20:49.556
no force is needed to make it go sideways, tangentially: if there were no force at all

L1-cue_231
00:20:49.556 --> 00:20:52.576
on it, it would just keep coasting this way.

L1-cue_232
00:20:52.576 --> 00:20:58.716
But actually, the planet doesn’t keep coasting this way, but finds itself later not out here,

L1-cue_233
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:06.956
where it would go if there were no force at all, but further down toward the sun.

L1-cue_234
00:21:06.956 --> 00:21:11.846
In other words, its velocity, its motion, has been deflected toward the sun.

L1-cue_235
00:21:11.846 --> 00:21:17.196
So what the angels have to do is to beat their wings in toward the sun all the time;

L1-cue_236
00:21:17.196 --> 00:21:22.666
that the motion to keep it going in a straight line has no known reason.

L1-cue_237
00:21:22.666 --> 00:21:27.706
#The reason why things coast forever has never been found out—

L1-cue_238
00:21:27.706 --> 00:21:31.046
the law of inertia has no known origin.

L1-cue_239
00:21:31.046 --> 00:21:35.796
So the angels don’t exist, but the continuation of the motion does.

L1-cue_240
00:21:35.796 --> 00:21:40.606
But in order to obtain the falling operation we do need a force.

L1-cue_241
00:21:40.606 --> 00:21:47.166
So it became apparent that the force was toward the sun.

L1-cue_242
00:21:47.166 --> 00:21:51.096
As a matter of fact, Newton was able to demonstrate that the statement

L1-cue_243
00:21:51.096 --> 00:21:57.036
that equal areas are swept in equal times was a direct consequence of the simple idea that all

L1-cue_244
00:21:57.036 --> 00:22:01.536
of the changes in velocity are directed exactly to the sun, even in the elliptical case.

L1-cue_245
00:22:01.536 --> 00:22:09.426
Maybe I’ll have time next time to show you how that works in detail.

L1-cue_246
00:22:09.426 --> 00:22:13.846
#So from this law, he would confirm the idea that the force is toward the sun—

L1-cue_247
00:22:13.846 --> 00:22:17.406
and from knowing how the periods of the different planets vary with the distance away

L1-cue_248
00:22:17.406 --> 00:22:22.536
from the sun, it’s possible to determine how that force must weaken at different distances—

L1-cue_249
00:22:22.536 --> 00:22:29.916
and he was able to determine that the force must vary inversely as the square of the distance.

L1-cue_250
00:22:29.916 --> 00:22:37.556
Now, so far he hasn’t said anything new, because he only said the two things which Kepler said,

L1-cue_251
00:22:37.556 --> 00:22:41.366
in different language: one is exactly equivalent to the statement

L1-cue_252
00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:44.796
that the force is toward the sun; the other is exactly equivalent to the statement

L1-cue_253
00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:47.016
that the law is inversely as a square of the distance.

L1-cue_254
00:22:47.016 --> 00:22:52.356
#But: people had seen in telescopes that Jupiter’s satellites are going around Jupiter;

L1-cue_255
00:22:52.356 --> 00:22:55.756
it looked like a little solar system—so the satellites were attracted to Jupiter.

L1-cue_256
00:22:55.756 --> 00:22:57.366
And the moon is attracted to the earth,

L1-cue_257
00:22:57.366 --> 00:22:59.816
and goes around the earth—it’s attracted in the same way.

L1-cue_258
00:22:59.816 --> 00:23:02.306
So it looks like everything’s attracted to everything else.

L1-cue_259
00:23:02.306 --> 00:23:04.376
#The next statement was to generalize this—

L1-cue_260
00:23:04.376 --> 00:23:08.426
to say that every object attracts every other object.

L1-cue_261
00:23:08.426 --> 00:23:13.756
If so, the earth must be pulling on the moon, just as the sun pulls on the planets.

L1-cue_262
00:23:13.756 --> 00:23:18.076
But it’s known that the earth pulls on things, because you’re all sitting tightly in your seats

L1-cue_263
00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:23.766
in spite of your desires to float out of the hall at this time.

L1-cue_264
00:23:23.766 --> 00:23:29.236
The pull for objects on the earth was well known in the phenomenon of gravitation;

L1-cue_265
00:23:29.236 --> 00:23:34.836
it was Newton’s idea, then, that maybe the gravitation which held the moon

L1-cue_266
00:23:34.836 --> 00:23:41.536
in its orbit was the same gravitation that pulled objects toward the earth.

L1-cue_267
00:23:41.536 --> 00:23:48.796
#Now, it is easy to figure out how far the moon falls in one second, because if it went

L1-cue_268
00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:53.056
in a straight line—you know the size of the orbit; you know it takes a month to go around—

L1-cue_269
00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:57.356
and if you figure out how far it goes in one second, you can figure out how far the circle

L1-cue_270
00:23:57.356 --> 00:24:00.646
of the moon’s orbit has fallen below the straight line that it would have been

L1-cue_271
00:24:00.646 --> 00:24:04.696
in if it didn’t go the way it does go.

L1-cue_272
00:24:04.696 --> 00:24:11.596
This distance is 1/20th of an inch.

L1-cue_273
00:24:11.596 --> 00:24:16.826
#Now, the moon is 60 times as far away from the earth’s center than we are:

L1-cue_274
00:24:16.826 --> 00:24:21.846
we’re 4,000 miles away from the center, and the moon is 240,000 miles away from the center.

L1-cue_275
00:24:21.846 --> 00:24:27.796
So if the law of inverse square is right, an object at the earth’s surface should fall

L1-cue_276
00:24:27.796 --> 00:24:33.596
in one second by 1/20th of an inch times 3600 (being the square of 60,

L1-cue_277
00:24:33.596 --> 00:24:37.826
because the force has been weakened by 60 x 60 for the inverse square law,

L1-cue_278
00:24:37.826 --> 00:24:39.946
in getting out there to the moon).

L1-cue_279
00:24:39.946 --> 00:24:44.486
If you multiply a 20th of an inch by 3600, you get about 16 feet—

L1-cue_280
00:24:44.486 --> 00:24:50.066
and lo, it is known already from Galileo’s measurements that things fell in one second

L1-cue_281
00:24:50.066 --> 00:24:53.106
on the earth’s surface by 16 feet.

L1-cue_282
00:24:53.106 --> 00:24:58.866
So this meant, you see, that he was on the right track—there was no going back now!

L1-cue_283
00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:02.096
Because a new fact that was completely independent previously—

L1-cue_284
00:25:02.096 --> 00:25:06.766
the period of the moon’s orbit and its distance from the earth—was connected to another fact—

L1-cue_285
00:25:06.766 --> 00:25:10.276
how long it takes something to fall in one second.

L1-cue_286
00:25:10.276 --> 00:25:12.966
This was a dramatic test that everything’s all right.

L1-cue_287
00:25:12.966 --> 00:25:15.686
#Further, he had a lot of other predictions.

L1-cue_288
00:25:15.686 --> 00:25:18.976
He was able to calculate what the shape of the orbit should be with the law

L1-cue_289
00:25:18.976 --> 00:25:21.736
of the inverse square, and found, indeed, that it was an ellipse.

L1-cue_290
00:25:21.736 --> 00:25:24.996
So he got three for two, as it were.

L1-cue_291
00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:30.486
#In addition, a number of new phenomena now had obvious explanations.

L1-cue_292
00:25:30.486 --> 00:25:36.676
One was the tides: the tides were due to the pull of the moon on the earth.

L1-cue_293
00:25:36.676 --> 00:25:41.036
This had sometimes been thought of before, with the difficulty that if it was the pull

L1-cue_294
00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:47.986
of the moon on the earth—the earth being here and the water is being pulled up to the moon—

L1-cue_295
00:25:47.986 --> 00:25:52.336
then there would only be one tide a day where that bump of water is under the moon.

L1-cue_296
00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:57.336
But actually, you know, there are tides every 12 hours, roughly; that’s two tides a day.

L1-cue_297
00:25:57.336 --> 00:26:01.206
#There was another school of thought that had a different conclusion:

L1-cue_298
00:26:01.206 --> 00:26:14.076
their theory was that it was the earth that was pulled by the moon, away from the water!

L1-cue_299
00:26:14.076 --> 00:26:18.376
Newton was the first one to realize what actually was going on:

L1-cue_300
00:26:18.376 --> 00:26:24.766
that the force of the moon on the earth, and on the water, is the same at the same distance—

L1-cue_301
00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:29.016
and that the water here is closer to the moon, and the water here is further from the moon

L1-cue_302
00:26:29.016 --> 00:26:34.096
than the earth—than the rigid earth—so that the water is pulled more toward the moon here,

L1-cue_303
00:26:34.096 --> 00:26:37.666
and here is less toward the moon than the earth, so there’s a combination

L1-cue_304
00:26:37.666 --> 00:26:40.466
of those two pictures that makes a double tide.

L1-cue_305
00:26:40.466 --> 00:26:46.866
#Actually, the earth does the same trick as the moon: it goes around a circle, really.

L1-cue_306
00:26:46.866 --> 00:26:50.466
I mean, the force of the moon on the earth is balanced, but by what?

L1-cue_307
00:26:50.466 --> 00:26:54.366
By the fact that—just like the moon goes in a circle to balance the earth’s force—

L1-cue_308
00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:56.126
the earth is also going in a circle.

L1-cue_309
00:26:56.126 --> 00:26:58.846
Actually, the center of that circle is somewhere inside the earth;

L1-cue_310
00:26:58.846 --> 00:27:01.806
it’s also going in a circle to balance the moon.

L1-cue_311
00:27:01.806 --> 00:27:04.426
So the two of them go around a common center here—

L1-cue_312
00:27:04.426 --> 00:27:09.516
and, if you wish, this water is thrown off by centrifugal force more than the earth is,

L1-cue_313
00:27:09.516 --> 00:27:12.536
and this water’s attracted more than this average of the earth.

L1-cue_314
00:27:12.536 --> 00:27:19.206
At any rate, the tides were then explained, and the fact that there were two a day.

L1-cue_315
00:27:19.206 --> 00:27:21.516
#A lot of other things became quite clear:

L1-cue_316
00:27:21.516 --> 00:27:25.456
why the earth is round (because everything gets pulled in)

L1-cue_317
00:27:25.456 --> 00:27:29.416
and why it isn’t exactly round (because it’s spinning, so the outside gets thrown

L1-cue_318
00:27:29.416 --> 00:27:36.066
out a little bit and it balances), and why the sun and moon are round, and so on.

L1-cue_319
00:27:36.066 --> 00:27:40.676
#Now, as science developed and measurements were made ever more accurately,

L1-cue_320
00:27:40.676 --> 00:27:44.026
the tests of Newton’s law became much more stringent.

L1-cue_321
00:27:44.026 --> 00:27:49.186
The first careful tests involved the moons of Jupiter: by careful observations

L1-cue_322
00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:53.136
of the way they went around over a long period of time, one could be very careful to check

L1-cue_323
00:27:53.136 --> 00:27:55.416
that everything was according to Hoyle... —Newton;

L1-cue_324
00:27:55.416 --> 00:27:58.346
it turned out not to be the case.

L1-cue_325
00:27:58.346 --> 00:28:03.626
The moons of Jupiter appeared to get sometimes eight minutes ahead of time,

L1-cue_326
00:28:03.626 --> 00:28:06.056
and sometimes eight minutes behind schedule,

L1-cue_327
00:28:06.056 --> 00:28:10.046
where "schedule" is the calculated values according to Newton’s laws—

L1-cue_328
00:28:10.046 --> 00:28:14.386
it was noticed that they were ahead of schedule when they were close, when Jupiter was close

L1-cue_329
00:28:14.386 --> 00:28:18.646
to the earth, and behind schedule when it was far away—a rather odd circumstance.

L1-cue_330
00:28:18.646 --> 00:28:22.086
#Ole Romer [in 1676], having confidence in the law of gravitation,

L1-cue_331
00:28:22.086 --> 00:28:26.586
came to an interesting conclusion: that it takes light some time to travel from the moons

L1-cue_332
00:28:26.586 --> 00:28:30.566
to the earth, and that what we’re looking at when we see the moons is not how they are now,

L1-cue_333
00:28:30.566 --> 00:28:34.056
but how they were the time ago that it took the light to get here.

L1-cue_334
00:28:34.056 --> 00:28:38.256
Now, when Jupiter is near us, it takes less time for the light to come,

L1-cue_335
00:28:38.256 --> 00:28:40.016
and when Jupiter is further, it takes longer time.

L1-cue_336
00:28:40.016 --> 00:28:43.426
So he had to correct the observations for the differences in time.

L1-cue_337
00:28:43.426 --> 00:28:47.936
And by the fact that they were this too much early or that much too late,

L1-cue_338
00:28:47.936 --> 00:28:49.706
was able to determine the velocity of light.

L1-cue_339
00:28:49.706 --> 00:28:54.746
#This was the first demonstration that light is not an instantaneously propagating material.

L1-cue_340
00:28:54.746 --> 00:28:59.436
I bring this particular matter to your attention because it illustrates something:

L1-cue_341
00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:04.886
when a law is right, it can be used to find another one.

L1-cue_342
00:29:04.886 --> 00:29:09.276
By having confidence in this law, if something is the matter it suggests,

L1-cue_343
00:29:09.276 --> 00:29:11.526
perhaps, some other phenomenon.

L1-cue_344
00:29:11.526 --> 00:29:15.336
If we had not known the law of gravitation, we would have taken much longer to find the speed

L1-cue_345
00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:20.296
of light, because we would not have known what to expect of Jupiter’s satellites.

L1-cue_346
00:29:20.296 --> 00:29:24.646
This process has developed into an avalanche of discoveries:

L1-cue_347
00:29:24.646 --> 00:29:30.386
each new discovery permits the tools for much more discovery, and this is the beginning

L1-cue_348
00:29:30.386 --> 00:29:35.766
of that avalanche which has gone on, now, for 400 years in a continuous process—

L1-cue_349
00:29:35.766 --> 00:29:41.866
and we’re still avalanching along at high speed at this time.

L1-cue_350
00:29:41.866 --> 00:29:46.246
#Another problem came up: the planets shouldn’t really go in ellipses,

L1-cue_351
00:29:46.246 --> 00:29:50.806
because according to Newton’s laws, they’re not attracted only by the sun, but also they pull

L1-cue_352
00:29:50.806 --> 00:29:52.736
on each other—a little bit, only a little bit.

L1-cue_353
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:58.096
But a little bit is something, and will alter the motion a little bit.

L1-cue_354
00:29:58.096 --> 00:30:03.146
So Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus were big planets that were known, and calculations were made

L1-cue_355
00:30:03.146 --> 00:30:07.056
as to how slightly different than the perfect ellipses of Kepler the planets ought

L1-cue_356
00:30:07.056 --> 00:30:11.966
to be going—Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus—by the pull of one on each other.

L1-cue_357
00:30:11.966 --> 00:30:14.866
When they were finished (the calculations, I mean, and the observations),

L1-cue_358
00:30:14.866 --> 00:30:18.816
it was noticed that Jupiter and Saturn went according to the calculations,

L1-cue_359
00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:21.076
but that Uranus was doing something funny—

L1-cue_360
00:30:21.076 --> 00:30:24.266
another opportunity for Newton’s laws to be found wanting.

L1-cue_361
00:30:24.266 --> 00:30:32.826
#But, courage: two men—both who made these calculations, Adams and Le Verrier,

L1-cue_362
00:30:32.826 --> 00:30:35.836
independently and at almost exactly the same time—

L1-cue_363
00:30:35.836 --> 00:30:42.176
proposed that the motions of Uranus were due to an unseen-as-yet new planet.

L1-cue_364
00:30:42.176 --> 00:30:45.476
They wrote letters to their respective observatories telling them to look:

L1-cue_365
00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:48.366
turn your telescope, and look there, and you’ll find a planet.

L1-cue_366
00:30:48.366 --> 00:30:53.396
How absurd!—said one of the observatories—that some guy sitting with pieces of paper

L1-cue_367
00:30:53.396 --> 00:30:57.186
and pencils can tell us where we look to find some new planet!

L1-cue_368
00:30:57.186 --> 00:31:01.626
The other observatory was more—well, less—

L1-cue_369
00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:16.816
well, the administration was different—and they found Neptune.

L1-cue_370
00:31:16.816 --> 00:31:20.536
#More recently, in the beginning of the 20th century, it became apparent that the motion

L1-cue_371
00:31:20.536 --> 00:31:25.866
of the planet Mercury was not exactly right, and this caused a lot of trouble

L1-cue_372
00:31:25.866 --> 00:31:30.716
and had no explanation, until a modification of Newton’s—this did show, ultimately,

L1-cue_373
00:31:30.716 --> 00:31:34.066
that Newton’s laws were slightly off, and that they had to be modified.

L1-cue_374
00:31:34.066 --> 00:31:38.666
I will not discuss the modification in detail; it was made by Einstein.

L1-cue_375
00:31:38.666 --> 00:31:44.906
#Now the question is, how far does this law extend?

L1-cue_376
00:31:44.906 --> 00:31:47.426
Does it extent outside the solar system?

L1-cue_377
00:31:47.426 --> 00:31:51.116
And so I show, on the first slide, evidence that the law of gravitation is

L1-cue_378
00:31:51.116 --> 00:31:55.486
on a wider scale than just the solar system.

L1-cue_379
00:31:55.486 --> 00:32:01.216
Here is a series of three pictures of a so—called double star.

L1-cue_380
00:32:01.216 --> 00:32:03.656
There’s a third star, fortunately, in the picture,

L1-cue_381
00:32:03.656 --> 00:32:05.546
so you can see that they’re really turning around [each other],

L1-cue_382
00:32:05.546 --> 00:32:08.556
and that nobody just simply turned the frames of the pictures around,

L1-cue_383
00:32:08.556 --> 00:32:10.926
which is easy to do on astronomical pictures.

L1-cue_384
00:32:10.926 --> 00:32:13.146
But the stars are actually going around [each other].

L1-cue_385
00:32:13.146 --> 00:32:15.306
By watching these things and plotting the orbit,

L1-cue_386
00:32:15.306 --> 00:32:19.146
you see the orbit that they make on the next slide.

L1-cue_387
00:32:19.146 --> 00:32:21.776
It’s evident that they’re attracting each other, and that they’re going

L1-cue_388
00:32:21.776 --> 00:32:25.366
around in an ellipse according to the way expected: these are a succession

L1-cue_389
00:32:25.366 --> 00:32:30.176
of pictures going for all these different periods of time, I think—

L1-cue_390
00:32:30.176 --> 00:32:33.686
yes, it goes around this way—and they didn’t see it well when it was too close,

L1-cue_391
00:32:33.686 --> 00:32:40.166
and here it is in 1905—my slide is very old; It’s gone around maybe once more since.

L1-cue_392
00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:44.046
#You’ll be happy, except when you notice, if you haven’t noticed already,

L1-cue_393
00:32:44.046 --> 00:32:48.036
that the center is not a focus of the ellipse, but it’s quite a bit off.

L1-cue_394
00:32:48.036 --> 00:32:51.756
So something’s the matter with the law?

L1-cue_395
00:32:51.756 --> 00:32:56.466
No: god hasn’t presented us with this orbit face on; it’s tilted at a funny angle.

L1-cue_396
00:32:56.466 --> 00:32:59.976
If you take an ellipse and mark its focus, and then hold the paper at an odd angle and look

L1-cue_397
00:32:59.976 --> 00:33:05.146
at it in projection, the focus doesn’t have to be at the focus of the projected image.

L1-cue_398
00:33:05.146 --> 00:33:09.036
So it’s because its orbit is tilted in space that it looks that way.

L1-cue_399
00:33:09.036 --> 00:33:11.726
It looks like it’s not the right pattern, but it’s all right,

L1-cue_400
00:33:11.726 --> 00:33:15.266
and you can figure everything out satisfactorily for that.

L1-cue_401
00:33:15.266 --> 00:33:16.936
How about a bigger distance?

L1-cue_402
00:33:16.936 --> 00:33:21.906
There’s forces between the stars: does it go any further than these distances, which are not more

L1-cue_403
00:33:21.906 --> 00:33:25.186
than two or three times the solar system’s diameter?

L1-cue_404
00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:29.016
#Here’s something, in the next slide, that’s 100,000 times

L1-cue_405
00:33:29.016 --> 00:33:31.516
as big as a solar system in diameter.

L1-cue_406
00:33:31.516 --> 00:33:37.176
This is a large number of stars, a tremendous number of stars:

L1-cue_407
00:33:37.176 --> 00:33:41.436
this white spot is not a solid white spot; it’s just because of the failure of our instruments

L1-cue_408
00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:45.506
to resolve it, but these are very, very tiny dots just like the other stars,

L1-cue_409
00:33:45.506 --> 00:33:49.956
well separated from one another, not hitting each other, each one falling through and back

L1-cue_410
00:33:49.956 --> 00:33:52.996
and forth through this great globular cluster.

L1-cue_411
00:33:52.996 --> 00:33:57.866
#It’s one of the most beautiful things in the sky—as good as sea waves and sunsets.

L1-cue_412
00:33:57.866 --> 00:34:01.056
And the distribution of this material—

L1-cue_413
00:34:01.056 --> 00:34:02.426
it’s perfectly clear that the thing

L1-cue_414
00:34:02.426 --> 00:34:07.376
that holds this together is the gravitational attraction of the stars for each other.

L1-cue_415
00:34:07.376 --> 00:34:11.716
The distribution of the material—in the sense of how the stars peter out as you go

L1-cue_416
00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:17.136
out in distance—permits one to find out, roughly, what the law is of force

L1-cue_417
00:34:17.136 --> 00:34:21.376
between the stars—and, of course, it comes out right; it is, roughly, the inverse square.

L1-cue_418
00:34:21.376 --> 00:34:25.796
(The accuracy of these calculations and measurements is not anywhere near

L1-cue_419
00:34:25.796 --> 00:34:28.826
as careful as in the solar system.)

L1-cue_420
00:34:28.826 --> 00:34:31.076
#Onward! Does gravity extend still further?

L1-cue_421
00:34:31.076 --> 00:34:34.526
This is a little pinpoint inside of a big galaxy,

L1-cue_422
00:34:34.526 --> 00:34:40.156
and the next slide shows a typical galaxy: it’s clear that this thing, again,

L1-cue_423
00:34:40.156 --> 00:34:45.176
is held together somehow, and the only candidate that’s reasonable is gravitation.

L1-cue_424
00:34:45.176 --> 00:34:51.326
But when we get to this size, we haven’t any way any longer to check the inverse square law,

L1-cue_425
00:34:51.326 --> 00:34:55.776
but there seems to be no doubt that these great agglomerations of stars—

L1-cue_426
00:34:55.776 --> 00:35:02.356
these galaxies, which are 50,000 to 100,000 light years across (the solar system is, well,

L1-cue_427
00:35:02.356 --> 00:35:08.796
from the earth to the sun is only eight light minutes); this is 100,000 light years—

L1-cue_428
00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:11.336
that gravity is extending even over these distances.

L1-cue_429
00:35:11.336 --> 00:35:14.286
#In the next slide is evidence that it extends even further:

L1-cue_430
00:35:14.286 --> 00:35:18.526
here is what is called a cluster of galaxies.

L1-cue_431
00:35:18.526 --> 00:35:22.176
There’s a galaxy here and here and here; there are galaxies here.

L1-cue_432
00:35:22.176 --> 00:35:27.246
They’re all in one lump of galaxies—analogous to the cluster of stars,

L1-cue_433
00:35:27.246 --> 00:35:34.996
but this time what’s clustered are those big babies that I showed you in this previous slide.

L1-cue_434
00:35:34.996 --> 00:35:43.266
Now, this is as far as about one tenth—well, 100th maybe—of the size of the universe,

L1-cue_435
00:35:43.266 --> 00:35:49.116
and as far as we have any direct evidence that gravitational forces extend.

L1-cue_436
00:35:49.116 --> 00:35:57.276
So the earth’s gravitation, if we take the view, has no edge (as you may read in the newspapers,

L1-cue_437
00:35:57.276 --> 00:36:02.646
when the planet gets "outside the field of gravity"); it keeps on going, ever weaker

L1-cue_438
00:36:02.646 --> 00:36:04.986
and weaker, inversely as the square of the distance,

L1-cue_439
00:36:04.986 --> 00:36:10.216
dividing by four each time you’re twice as far away, until it mingles with the strong fields

L1-cue_440
00:36:10.216 --> 00:36:13.566
and gets lost in the confusion of the strong fields of other stars—

L1-cue_441
00:36:13.566 --> 00:36:17.696
but all together, with the stars in its neighborhood, pulls the other stars

L1-cue_442
00:36:17.696 --> 00:36:22.526
to form the galaxy, and, all together, they pull on other galaxies to make a pattern.

L1-cue_443
00:36:22.526 --> 00:36:24.376
or cluster, of galaxies.

L1-cue_444
00:36:24.376 --> 00:36:30.126
#So the earth’s gravitational field never ends, but peters out very slowly in a precise

L1-cue_445
00:36:30.126 --> 00:36:38.896
and careful law, probably to the edges of the universe.

L1-cue_446
00:36:38.896 --> 00:36:41.976
The law of gravitation is different than many of the other [laws]—

L1-cue_447
00:36:41.976 --> 00:36:49.816
well, it is very important in the economy, or in the machinery, of the universe;

L1-cue_448
00:36:49.816 --> 00:36:54.146
there are many places where gravity has its practical applications

L1-cue_449
00:36:54.146 --> 00:36:55.966
as far as the universe is concerned.

L1-cue_450
00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:58.686
But atypically among all the other laws of physics,

L1-cue_451
00:36:58.686 --> 00:37:02.996
gravitation has relatively few practical applications [for us].

L1-cue_452
00:37:02.996 --> 00:37:05.186
I mean, the new knowledge of the law has a lot of applications—

L1-cue_453
00:37:05.186 --> 00:37:07.486
it keeps people in their seats and so on—

L1-cue_454
00:37:07.486 --> 00:37:11.076
but the knowledge of the law has few practical applications,

L1-cue_455
00:37:11.076 --> 00:37:12.936
relatively speaking, compared to the other laws.

L1-cue_456
00:37:12.936 --> 00:37:15.816
#This is one case in which I picked an atypical example.

L1-cue_457
00:37:15.816 --> 00:37:19.916
(It is impossible, by the way, by picking one example of anything, to avoid picking one

L1-cue_458
00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:23.056
which is atypical in some sense—that’s the wonder of the world.)

L1-cue_459
00:37:23.056 --> 00:37:29.076
The only applications I could think of were, first, in some geophysical prospecting,

L1-cue_460
00:37:29.076 --> 00:37:35.176
in predicting the tides; nowadays, more modernly, in working out the motions

L1-cue_461
00:37:35.176 --> 00:37:40.456
of the satellites and the planet probes, and so on, that we send up—

L1-cue_462
00:37:40.456 --> 00:37:44.866
and also, modernly, to calculate the predictions of the planet’s position,

L1-cue_463
00:37:44.866 --> 00:37:47.416
which have great utility for astrologers

L1-cue_464
00:37:47.416 --> 00:37:51.736
to publish their predictions and horoscopes in the magazines.

L1-cue_465
00:37:51.736 --> 00:38:00.246
That’s the strange world we live in, that all the advances and understanding are used only

L1-cue_466
00:38:00.246 --> 00:38:07.526
to continue the nonsense which has existed for 2,000 years.

L1-cue_467
00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:12.946
#Now, that shows that gravitation extends to the great distances,

L1-cue_468
00:38:12.946 --> 00:38:15.236
but Newton said that everything attracted everything else.

L1-cue_469
00:38:15.236 --> 00:38:16.456
Do I attract you?

L1-cue_470
00:38:16.456 --> 00:38:18.096
Excuse me, I mean, do I attract you?

L1-cue_471
00:38:18.096 --> 00:38:21.986
I was going to say, excuse me, do I attract you physically?

L1-cue_472
00:38:21.986 --> 00:38:23.086
I didn’t mean that.

L1-cue_473
00:38:23.086 --> 00:38:32.086
#What I mean is, is it really true that two things attract each other directly?

L1-cue_474
00:38:32.086 --> 00:38:35.756
Can we make a direct test, and not just wait for the planets and look at the planets

L1-cue_475
00:38:35.756 --> 00:38:37.906
to see if they attract each other?

L1-cue_476
00:38:37.906 --> 00:38:46.696
This experiment—the direct test—was made by Cavendish on equipment which you see indicated

L1-cue_477
00:38:46.696 --> 00:38:52.186
on the next slide (if I got my slides right).

L1-cue_478
00:38:52.186 --> 00:39:02.356
#Well, I made a mistake: I was talking about the importance of gravitation, and I was overwhelmed

L1-cue_479
00:39:02.356 --> 00:39:06.566
by my clever remark about astrologers, and forgot to mention the important places

L1-cue_480
00:39:06.566 --> 00:39:10.446
where gravitation does have some real effect in the behavior of the universe.

L1-cue_481
00:39:10.446 --> 00:39:13.996
One of the interesting ones is the formation of new stars.

L1-cue_482
00:39:13.996 --> 00:39:19.896
In this picture, which is a gaseous nebula inside our own galaxy (and is not a lot

L1-cue_483
00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:22.156
of stars, but is gas), there are places

L1-cue_484
00:39:22.156 --> 00:39:26.206
where the gas has been compressed or attracted to itself here.

L1-cue_485
00:39:26.206 --> 00:39:29.826
It starts, perhaps, by some kind of shock waves to get collected,

L1-cue_486
00:39:29.826 --> 00:39:33.626
but the remainder of the phenomenon is gravitation pulls the cloud

L1-cue_487
00:39:33.626 --> 00:39:35.726
of gas closer and closer together.

L1-cue_488
00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:42.206
So big mobs of gas and dust collect and form balls, which, as they fall still further,

L1-cue_489
00:39:42.206 --> 00:39:47.836
the heat generated by the falling, lights them up and they become stars—

L1-cue_490
00:39:47.836 --> 00:39:52.696
and we have in the next slide some evidence of the creation of new stars.

L1-cue_491
00:39:52.696 --> 00:39:59.206
It is, unfortunately, harder to see than I thought it was when I looked at it before,

L1-cue_492
00:39:59.206 --> 00:40:01.696
but this is not exactly the same as this.

L1-cue_493
00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:09.576
This bump here is further out than here and that this also has a new dot here.

L1-cue_494
00:40:09.576 --> 00:40:14.216
There are- I have found better examples but were unable to produce a slide.

L1-cue_495
00:40:14.216 --> 00:40:17.346
#There is one example of a star patch—light—

L1-cue_496
00:40:17.346 --> 00:40:23.936
that grew in a place in 200 days so that —when—there—is— in the same kind of a condition

L1-cue_497
00:40:23.936 --> 00:40:28.816
of a gas cloud, when the gas collects too much together by gravitation, stars are born,

L1-cue_498
00:40:28.816 --> 00:40:31.366
and this is the beginning of new stars.

L1-cue_499
00:40:31.366 --> 00:40:36.466
The stars belch out dirt and gasses when they explode, sometimes, and the dirt

L1-cue_500
00:40:36.466 --> 00:40:42.976
and gasses then collect back again and make new stars—it sounds like perpetual motion.

L1-cue_501
00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:46.606
#I now turn to the subject I meant to introduce, which was the experiments

L1-cue_502
00:40:46.606 --> 00:40:49.956
on the small scale, to see whether things really attract each other.

L1-cue_503
00:40:49.956 --> 00:40:54.356
And I hope, now, that the next slide does indicate—this is the second try, Yeah!

L1-cue_504
00:40:54.356 --> 00:40:56.316
—Cavendish’s experiment.

L1-cue_505
00:40:56.316 --> 00:41:04.136
The idea was to hang, by a very, very fine quartz fiber, a rod with two balls—

L1-cue_506
00:41:04.136 --> 00:41:06.116
and then put two large lead balls

L1-cue_507
00:41:06.116 --> 00:41:09.636
in the positions indicated here, next to it on the side.

L1-cue_508
00:41:09.636 --> 00:41:15.276
Then, because of the attraction of the balls, there would be a slight twist to the fiber.

L1-cue_509
00:41:15.276 --> 00:41:17.956
It had to be done so delicately because the gravitational force

L1-cue_510
00:41:17.956 --> 00:41:21.936
between ordinary things is very, very tiny indeed.

L1-cue_511
00:41:21.936 --> 00:41:23.616
And there it was.

L1-cue_512
00:41:23.616 --> 00:41:27.786
It was possible, then, to measure the force between these two balls.

L1-cue_513
00:41:27.786 --> 00:41:32.776
Cavendish called his experiment "weighing the earth".

L1-cue_514
00:41:32.776 --> 00:41:37.416
#We’re pedantic and careful today; we wouldn’t let our students say that:

L1-cue_515
00:41:37.416 --> 00:41:41.066
we would have to say they’re measuring the mass of the earth.

L1-cue_516
00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:45.796
But the reason he said that is the following: by a direct experiment he was able

L1-cue_517
00:41:45.796 --> 00:41:48.966
to measure the force, the two masses, and the distance,

L1-cue_518
00:41:48.966 --> 00:41:51.726
and thus determine the gravitational constant.

L1-cue_519
00:41:51.726 --> 00:41:55.936
You say, yes, but we have the same situation on the earth: we know what the pull is,

L1-cue_520
00:41:55.936 --> 00:41:59.266
and we know what the mass of the object pulled is, and we know how far away we are—

L1-cue_521
00:41:59.266 --> 00:42:04.346
but we don’t know either the mass of the earth or the constant, but only the combination.

L1-cue_522
00:42:04.346 --> 00:42:08.216
So by measuring the constant, and knowing the facts about the pull of the earth,

L1-cue_523
00:42:08.216 --> 00:42:10.186
the mass of the earth could be determined.

L1-cue_524
00:42:10.186 --> 00:42:14.996
#So, indirectly, this experiment was the first determination of how heavy,

L1-cue_525
00:42:14.996 --> 00:42:19.366
or how massive, is the ball on which we stand.

L1-cue_526
00:42:19.366 --> 00:42:22.616
Like it’s a kind of amazing achievement to find that out,

L1-cue_527
00:42:22.616 --> 00:42:25.196
and I think that’s why Cavendish named his experiment that way,

L1-cue_528
00:42:25.196 --> 00:42:29.096
instead of determining the constant in the gravitation equation.

L1-cue_529
00:42:29.096 --> 00:42:33.616
#"Weighing the earth."

L1-cue_530
00:42:33.616 --> 00:42:38.376
#He, incidentally, was weighing the sun and everything else at the same time,

L1-cue_531
00:42:38.376 --> 00:42:44.236
because the pull of the sun is known in the same manner.

L1-cue_532
00:42:44.236 --> 00:42:50.856
Now, one other test of the law of gravitation is very interesting, and that is the question

L1-cue_533
00:42:50.856 --> 00:42:57.906
as to whether the pull is exactly proportional to the mass.

L1-cue_534
00:42:57.906 --> 00:43:01.716
If the pull is exactly proportional to the mass, and the reaction to forces—

L1-cue_535
00:43:01.716 --> 00:43:04.996
the motions induced by forces, the changes in velocity—

L1-cue_536
00:43:04.996 --> 00:43:08.856
are inversely proportional to the mass, that means that two objects

L1-cue_537
00:43:08.856 --> 00:43:13.406
of different mass will change their velocity in the same manner in a gravitational field.

L1-cue_538
00:43:13.406 --> 00:43:16.506
Or: two different things, no matter what their mass,

L1-cue_539
00:43:16.506 --> 00:43:20.226
in a vacuum will fall the same way toward the earth.

L1-cue_540
00:43:20.226 --> 00:43:24.156
That’s Galileo’s old experiment from the leaning tower.

L1-cue_541
00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:27.666
#I took my young son of two and a half to the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

L1-cue_542
00:43:27.666 --> 00:43:33.666
and now every time a guest comes he says, "Leaning Towah!"

L1-cue_543
00:43:33.666 --> 00:43:41.696
Anyhow, it means, for example, that in a satellite (I mean a man—made satellite),

L1-cue_544
00:43:41.696 --> 00:43:46.046
an object inside will go around the earth in the same kind of an orbit as the satellite

L1-cue_545
00:43:46.046 --> 00:43:49.626
on the outside, and thus float in the middle, apparently.

L1-cue_546
00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:53.446
#This fact—that the force is exactly proportional to the mass

L1-cue_547
00:43:53.446 --> 00:43:56.186
and that the reactions are inversely to proportional mass—

L1-cue_548
00:43:56.186 --> 00:43:58.476
has this very interesting consequence.

L1-cue_549
00:43:58.476 --> 00:44:01.366
The question is, how accurate is it?

L1-cue_550
00:44:01.366 --> 00:44:07.616
It has been measured by an experiment by a man named Eotvos in 1909,

L1-cue_551
00:44:07.616 --> 00:44:14.146
and very much more recently and more accurately by Dicke, and it was known that one part

L1-cue_552
00:44:14.146 --> 00:44:19.186
in ten thousand million the mass is exactly proportional—

L1-cue_553
00:44:19.186 --> 00:44:24.446
I mean, the forces are exactly proportional to the mass.

L1-cue_554
00:44:24.446 --> 00:44:29.746
How it’s possible to measure with that accuracy, I wish I had the time to explain,

L1-cue_555
00:44:29.746 --> 00:44:33.486
but I’m afraid I cannot—it’s remarkably clever.

L1-cue_556
00:44:33.486 --> 00:44:35.776
#I’ll give a hint, however; I’ll give one hint.

L1-cue_557
00:44:35.776 --> 00:44:39.666
Suppose that you wanted to measure whether it’s true for the pull of the sun.

L1-cue_558
00:44:39.666 --> 00:44:43.536
You know the sun is pulling us all; it pulls the earth, too.

L1-cue_559
00:44:43.536 --> 00:44:46.796
But suppose you wanted to know whether, if you add a piece of lead here,

L1-cue_560
00:44:46.796 --> 00:44:54.396
and a piece of copper here (or polyethylene and lead—it was first done with sandalwood;

L1-cue_561
00:44:54.396 --> 00:45:01.826
now it’s done with polyethylene)—whether the pull is exactly proportional to the inertia.

L1-cue_562
00:45:01.826 --> 00:45:06.386
The earth is going around the sun, so these things are thrown out by inertia.

L1-cue_563
00:45:06.386 --> 00:45:09.946
They’re thrown out to the extent that these two objects have inertia.

L1-cue_564
00:45:09.946 --> 00:45:15.276
But they’re attracted to the sun to the extent that they have mass in the attraction law.

L1-cue_565
00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:18.116
So if they’re attracted to the sun in a different proportion than they’re thrown

L1-cue_566
00:45:18.116 --> 00:45:21.396
out by inertia, one will be pulled toward the sun and the other away.

L1-cue_567
00:45:21.396 --> 00:45:24.426
And so, hanging on another one of those Cavendish quartz fibers,

L1-cue_568
00:45:24.426 --> 00:45:26.576
the thing will twist toward the sun.

L1-cue_569
00:45:26.576 --> 00:45:30.636
It doesn’t twist at this accuracy, so we know that the sun’s attraction

L1-cue_570
00:45:30.636 --> 00:45:34.766
for these two objects is exactly proportional to the centrifugal effect, which is inertia.

L1-cue_571
00:45:34.766 --> 00:45:38.676
So the force of attraction on an object is exactly proportional to its coefficient

L1-cue_572
00:45:38.676 --> 00:45:43.696
of inertia—in other words, its mass.

L1-cue_573
00:45:43.696 --> 00:45:46.726
#I should say something about the relation of gravitation to other forces—

L1-cue_574
00:45:46.726 --> 00:45:50.956
to other parts of nature, other phenomena in nature.

L1-cue_575
00:45:50.956 --> 00:45:54.166
I’ll have more to say of a general quality later,

L1-cue_576
00:45:54.166 --> 00:45:57.486
but there is one thing that’s particularly interesting,

L1-cue_577
00:45:57.486 --> 00:46:01.386
and that is that the inverse square law appears again: it appears in the electrical laws,

L1-cue_578
00:46:01.386 --> 00:46:05.806
for instance—that electricity also exerts forces inversely as the square

L1-cue_579
00:46:05.806 --> 00:46:08.496
of the distance, this time between charges.

L1-cue_580
00:46:08.496 --> 00:46:14.566
#And, one thinks perhaps that inverse square of the distance has some deep significance;

L1-cue_581
00:46:14.566 --> 00:46:18.036
maybe gravity and electricity are different aspects of the same thing.

L1-cue_582
00:46:18.036 --> 00:46:22.196
No one has ever succeeded in making gravity and electricity different aspects of the same thing;

L1-cue_583
00:46:22.196 --> 00:46:27.576
today, our theories of physics—the laws of physics—are a multitude of different parts

L1-cue_584
00:46:27.576 --> 00:46:29.736
and pieces that don’t fit together very well.

L1-cue_585
00:46:29.736 --> 00:46:32.716
#We don’t understand the one exactly in terms of the other.

L1-cue_586
00:46:32.716 --> 00:46:36.816
We don’t have one structure from which all is deduced; we have several pieces

L1-cue_587
00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:39.326
that don’t quite fit exactly, yet.

L1-cue_588
00:46:39.326 --> 00:46:42.086
That’s the reason why, in these lectures, instead of having the ability

L1-cue_589
00:46:42.086 --> 00:46:47.026
to tell you what the law of physics is, I have to talk about the things that are common

L1-cue_590
00:46:47.026 --> 00:46:52.206
to the various laws, because we don’t know—we don’t understand the connection between them—

L1-cue_591
00:46:52.206 --> 00:46:55.536
but what’s very strange is, that there are certain things that are the same in both.

L1-cue_592
00:46:55.536 --> 00:46:59.016
#But now let’s look again at the law of electricity:

L1-cue_593
00:46:59.016 --> 00:47:01.966
the law goes inversely is the square of the distance,

L1-cue_594
00:47:01.966 --> 00:47:06.286
but the thing that is remarkable is the tremendous difference in the strength

L1-cue_595
00:47:06.286 --> 00:47:08.596
of the electrical and gravitational laws.

L1-cue_596
00:47:08.596 --> 00:47:12.866
People who want to make electricity and gravitation out of the same thing will find

L1-cue_597
00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:15.716
that electricity is so much more powerful than gravity,

L1-cue_598
00:47:15.716 --> 00:47:18.196
that it’s hard to believe they could both have the same origin.

L1-cue_599
00:47:18.196 --> 00:47:20.426
#Now, how can I say one thing is more powerful than another?

L1-cue_600
00:47:20.426 --> 00:47:27.886
It depends on upon how much charge you have, and how much mass you have.

L1-cue_601
00:47:27.886 --> 00:47:31.616
You can’t talk about how strong gravity is by saying, "I take a lump of such

L1-cue_602
00:47:31.616 --> 00:47:35.086
and such a size," because you chose the size.

L1-cue_603
00:47:35.086 --> 00:47:38.106
If we try to get something that nature produces—

L1-cue_604
00:47:38.106 --> 00:47:42.666
her own pure number that has nothing to do with inches or years or anything to do

L1-cue_605
00:47:42.666 --> 00:47:47.016
with our own dimensions—we can do it this way: if we take the fundamental particles,

L1-cue_606
00:47:47.016 --> 00:47:50.686
such as an electron—any different ones will give different numbers,

L1-cue_607
00:47:50.686 --> 00:47:53.236
but to get an idea of the number, take electrons.

L1-cue_608
00:47:53.236 --> 00:47:55.616
Two electrons, each a fundamental particle; it’s an object.

L1-cue_609
00:47:55.616 --> 00:47:59.676
It’s not something I can—I don’t have to tell you what units I measure in.

L1-cue_610
00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:03.186
It’s two particles that are fundamental particles; they repel each other inversely

L1-cue_611
00:48:03.186 --> 00:48:06.776
as a square of the distance due to electricity, and they attract each other inversely

L1-cue_612
00:48:06.776 --> 00:48:08.616
as a square of the distance due to gravitation.

L1-cue_613
00:48:08.616 --> 00:48:13.346
#Question: what is the ratio of the gravitational force to the electrical force?

L1-cue_614
00:48:13.346 --> 00:48:15.556
That is illustrated on the next slide.

L1-cue_615
00:48:15.556 --> 00:48:22.836
The ratio of the gravitational attraction to the electrical repulsion is given by a number

L1-cue_616
00:48:22.836 --> 00:48:30.176
with 42 digits, and goes off here: all this is written very carefully out, so that’s 42 digits.

L1-cue_617
00:48:30.176 --> 00:48:36.676
Now, therein lies a very deep mystery: where could such a tremendous number come from?

L1-cue_618
00:48:36.676 --> 00:48:40.106
That means if you ever had a theory from which both of these things are to come,

L1-cue_619
00:48:40.106 --> 00:48:43.106
how could they come in such disproportion?

L1-cue_620
00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:47.836
From what equation has a solution which has for one, two kinds of forces, an attraction

L1-cue_621
00:48:47.836 --> 00:48:51.936
and a repulsion with that fantastic ratio?

L1-cue_622
00:48:51.936 --> 00:48:57.216
People have looked for such a large ratio in other places.

L1-cue_623
00:48:57.216 --> 00:48:58.736
They’re looking for a large number.

L1-cue_624
00:48:58.736 --> 00:49:01.486
They hope, for example, that there’s another large number.

L1-cue_625
00:49:01.486 --> 00:49:04.426
And if you want a large number why not take the diameter

L1-cue_626
00:49:04.426 --> 00:49:07.466
of the universe to the diameter of a proton.

L1-cue_627
00:49:07.466 --> 00:49:12.206
Amazingly enough, it also is a number with 42 digits.

L1-cue_628
00:49:12.206 --> 00:49:17.206
#So an interesting proposal is made that this ratio depends—is the same as—

L1-cue_629
00:49:17.206 --> 00:49:20.866
the ratio of the size of the universe to the diameter of a proton.

L1-cue_630
00:49:20.866 --> 00:49:23.986
But the universe is expanding with time,

L1-cue_631
00:49:23.986 --> 00:49:27.216
and that would mean the gravitational constant is changing with time.

L1-cue_632
00:49:27.216 --> 00:49:32.316
Although that’s a possibility, there’s no evidence to indicate that it’s in fact true,

L1-cue_633
00:49:32.316 --> 00:49:35.866
and there are several difficulties—I mean, partial indications, that it doesn’t,

L1-cue_634
00:49:35.866 --> 00:49:38.696
that the gravitational constant has not changed in that way.

L1-cue_635
00:49:38.696 --> 00:49:43.616
#So this tremendous number remains a mystery.

L1-cue_636
00:49:43.616 --> 00:49:47.516
I must say, to finish about the theory of gravitation, two more things.

L1-cue_637
00:49:47.516 --> 00:49:52.066
One is that Einstein had to modify the laws of gravitation in accordance

L1-cue_638
00:49:52.066 --> 00:49:54.626
with his principles of relativity.

L1-cue_639
00:49:54.626 --> 00:49:59.336
The first was—one of the principles was—that if x cannot occur instantaneously,

L1-cue_640
00:49:59.336 --> 00:50:04.326
while Newton’s theory said that the force was instantaneous, he has to modify Newton’s laws.

L1-cue_641
00:50:04.326 --> 00:50:07.066
They have very small effects, these modifications.

L1-cue_642
00:50:07.066 --> 00:50:09.866
#One of them is, all masses fall.

L1-cue_643
00:50:09.866 --> 00:50:14.206
Light has energy, and energy is equivalent to mass, so light should fall.

L1-cue_644
00:50:14.206 --> 00:50:18.756
That should mean that light going near the sun is deflected; it is.

L1-cue_645
00:50:18.756 --> 00:50:22.426
Also, the force of gravitation is slightly modified in his theory,

L1-cue_646
00:50:22.426 --> 00:50:25.636
so that the law is slightly changed—very, very slightly—

L1-cue_647
00:50:25.636 --> 00:50:29.126
and it is just the right amount to account for the slight discrepancy

L1-cue_648
00:50:29.126 --> 00:50:33.496
that was found in the movement of Mercury.

L1-cue_649
00:50:33.496 --> 00:50:37.416
#Finally, with connection to the laws of physics on a small scale:

L1-cue_650
00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:41.496
we have found that the behavior of matter on a small scale obeys laws so different,

L1-cue_651
00:50:41.496 --> 00:50:44.126
very different, than things on a large scale.

L1-cue_652
00:50:44.126 --> 00:50:48.676
And so the question is, how does gravity look on a small scale?

L1-cue_653
00:50:48.676 --> 00:50:52.086
#What is what is called a quantum theory of gravity?

L1-cue_654
00:50:52.086 --> 00:50:57.456
There is no quantum theory of gravity today: people have not succeeded completely

L1-cue_655
00:50:57.456 --> 00:51:01.196
in making a theory which is consistent with the uncertainty principles

L1-cue_656
00:51:01.196 --> 00:51:03.266
and the quantum mechanical principles.

L1-cue_657
00:51:03.266 --> 00:51:09.586
#I’ll discuss these principles in another lecture.

L1-cue_658
00:51:09.586 --> 00:51:17.326
#Now, finally, you will say to me, "Yes, you told us what happens, but what is this gravity?

L1-cue_659
00:51:17.326 --> 00:51:18.556
Where does it come from and what is it?

L1-cue_660
00:51:18.556 --> 00:51:24.116
Do you mean to tell me that the planet looks at the sun, sees how far it is,

L1-cue_661
00:51:24.116 --> 00:51:26.256
takes the inverse of the square of the distance,

L1-cue_662
00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:29.286
and then decides to move in accordance with that law?"

L1-cue_663
00:51:29.286 --> 00:51:34.356
In other words, although I’ve stated a mathematical law,

L1-cue_664
00:51:34.356 --> 00:51:37.786
I have given you no clue as to the mechanism.

L1-cue_665
00:51:37.786 --> 00:51:40.926
I will discuss the possibility of doing this in the next lecture,

L1-cue_666
00:51:40.926 --> 00:51:45.636
which is the relation of mathematics to physics.

L1-cue_667
00:51:45.636 --> 00:51:50.596
#But finally, in this lecture I would like to remark, just at the end here,

L1-cue_668
00:51:50.596 --> 00:51:57.086
to emphasize some characteristics that gravity has in common with the other laws

L1-cue_669
00:51:57.086 --> 00:52:01.096
that we have mentioned as we passed along.

L1-cue_670
00:52:01.096 --> 00:52:04.406
#The first is that it’s mathematical in its expression—

L1-cue_671
00:52:04.406 --> 00:52:09.036
the others are that way too; we’ll discuss that next time.

L1-cue_672
00:52:09.036 --> 00:52:12.376
#Second, it’s not exact—Einstein had to modify it.

L1-cue_673
00:52:12.376 --> 00:52:17.386
We know it isn’t quite right yet, because they have to put the quantum theory in—

L1-cue_674
00:52:17.386 --> 00:52:20.626
that’s the same with all our other laws; they’re not exact.

L1-cue_675
00:52:20.626 --> 00:52:23.476
#There’s always an edge of mystery; there’s always a place

L1-cue_676
00:52:23.476 --> 00:52:25.796
that we have some fiddling around to do yet.

L1-cue_677
00:52:25.796 --> 00:52:28.246
That, of course, is not a property—probably not a property,

L1-cue_678
00:52:28.246 --> 00:52:32.346
it may or may not be a property—of nature, but it certainly is common with all the laws

L1-cue_679
00:52:32.346 --> 00:52:36.046
as we know them today—it may be only a lack of knowledge.

L1-cue_680
00:52:36.046 --> 00:52:41.346
#But the most impressive fact is that gravity is simple:

L1-cue_681
00:52:41.346 --> 00:52:47.586
it is simple to state the principle completely, and have not left any vagueness

L1-cue_682
00:52:47.586 --> 00:52:50.326
for anybody to change the ideas about.

L1-cue_683
00:52:50.326 --> 00:52:53.486
It’s simple, and therefore it’s beautiful.

L1-cue_684
00:52:53.486 --> 00:52:54.786
It’s simple in its pattern.

L1-cue_685
00:52:54.786 --> 00:52:58.506
I don’t mean it’s simple in its action; the motions of the various planets

L1-cue_686
00:52:58.506 --> 00:53:02.186
and the perturbations of one on another can be quite complicated to work out,

L1-cue_687
00:53:02.186 --> 00:53:07.716
or to follow how all those stars in the globular cluster move, is quite beyond our ability.

L1-cue_688
00:53:07.716 --> 00:53:11.216
It’s complicated in its actions, but not in the basic pattern,

L1-cue_689
00:53:11.216 --> 00:53:16.126
or the system underneath the whole thing; that’s a simple thing.

L1-cue_690
00:53:16.126 --> 00:53:21.336
#That’s common in all our laws; they all turn out to be simple things,

L1-cue_691
00:53:21.336 --> 00:53:24.846
although complex in their actual actions.

L1-cue_692
00:53:24.846 --> 00:53:28.616
Finally comes the universality of the gravitational law.

L1-cue_693
00:53:28.616 --> 00:53:31.806
The fact that it extends over such enormous distances.

L1-cue_694
00:53:31.806 --> 00:53:35.686
That Newton, in his mind worrying about the solar system,

L1-cue_695
00:53:35.686 --> 00:53:39.296
was able to predict what would happen in an experiment of Cavendish,

L1-cue_696
00:53:39.296 --> 00:53:43.306
where Cavendish’s little model of the solar system—the two balls attracting—

L1-cue_697
00:53:43.306 --> 00:53:47.976
has to be expanded 10 million million times to become the solar system—

L1-cue_698
00:53:47.976 --> 00:53:52.676
and then 10 million million times expanded once again,

L1-cue_699
00:53:52.676 --> 00:53:58.726
and we find the galaxies attracting each other by exactly the same law.

L1-cue_700
00:53:58.726 --> 00:54:03.606
#Nature uses only the longest threads to weave her patterns, so that each small piece

L1-cue_701
00:54:03.606 --> 00:54:08.526
of her fabric reveals the organization of the entire tapestry.

L1-cue_702
00:54:08.526 --> 00:55:37.000
#Thank you.
