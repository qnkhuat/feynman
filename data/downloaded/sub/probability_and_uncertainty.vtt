##Title Probability and Uncertainty: the quantum mechanical view of nature

L6-cue_1
00:01:31.316 --> 00:01:35.496
#In the beginning of the history of experimental observation,

L6-cue_2
00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.836
or any other kind of observation on scientific things,

L6-cue_3
00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.326
it’s intuition-which is really based just on experience

L6-cue_4
00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:47.286
with everyday objects—that suggests reasonable explanations for things.

L6-cue_5
00:01:47.286 --> 00:01:53.556
#But as we try to widen, and make more consistent, our description of what we see,

L6-cue_6
00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:57.526
as it gets wider and wider and we see a greater range of phenomena,

L6-cue_7
00:01:57.526 --> 00:02:02.086
the explanations become what we call laws, instead of simple explanations.

L6-cue_8
00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:05.736
But the one important odd characteristic is that they often seem to become more

L6-cue_9
00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:11.476
and more unreasonable, and more and more intuitively far from obvious.

L6-cue_10
00:02:11.476 --> 00:02:18.776
#To take an example is the relativity theory, in which, for instance, the proposition is

L6-cue_11
00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:23.996
that if you think that two things occur at the same time, that’s just a subjective opinion:

L6-cue_12
00:02:23.996 --> 00:02:28.476
someone else could conclude that those two events, one was before the other,

L6-cue_13
00:02:28.476 --> 00:02:33.946
and that simultaneity is merely a subjective impression.

L6-cue_14
00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:38.766
#Now, there’s no reason why this should be otherwise, really.

L6-cue_15
00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:44.316
The things of the direct everyday experience involve large numbers of particles,

L6-cue_16
00:02:44.316 --> 00:02:50.616
or involve things moving very slowly, or involve other conditions that are very special

L6-cue_17
00:02:50.616 --> 00:02:55.176
and represent, in fact, a very limited experience with nature.

L6-cue_18
00:02:55.176 --> 00:03:00.786
It’s a small section only that one gets of natural phenomena from a direct experience;

L6-cue_19
00:03:00.786 --> 00:03:04.816
it’s only through the refined measurements and careful experimentation

L6-cue_20
00:03:04.816 --> 00:03:10.856
that we can get a wider vision—and then we see unexpected things.

L6-cue_21
00:03:10.856 --> 00:03:18.776
#We see things that are far from what we would guess; we see things that are very far

L6-cue_22
00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.156
from what we would—could have imagined.

L6-cue_23
00:03:21.156 --> 00:03:26.266
And so our imagination is stretched to the utmost—not as in fiction,

L6-cue_24
00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:32.686
to imagine things which aren’t really there, but our imagination is stretched to the utmost just

L6-cue_25
00:03:32.686 --> 00:03:39.576
to comprehend those things which are there—and it’s this kind of a situation

L6-cue_26
00:03:39.576 --> 00:03:41.546
that I want to talk about tonight.

L6-cue_27
00:03:41.546 --> 00:03:46.026
Start, for instance, with the history of light.

L6-cue_28
00:03:46.026 --> 00:03:52.786
#At first, light was seen to behave—it would appear to behave—very much like a rain

L6-cue_29
00:03:52.786 --> 00:04:00.046
of particles, of "corpuscles," like rain, bullets from a gun, same idea.

L6-cue_30
00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:04.466
Then, with further research, it was clear that it was not right,

L6-cue_31
00:04:04.466 --> 00:04:09.576
but that light actually behaved like waves, like water waves, for instance.

L6-cue_32
00:04:09.576 --> 00:04:13.086
And then in the 20th century, on further research,

L6-cue_33
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:18.596
it appeared that light actually behaved, in many ways, again like particles.

L6-cue_34
00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:23.096
In the photoelectric effect you could count these particles—they’re called photons now—and

L6-cue_35
00:04:23.096 --> 00:04:25.576
so forth.

L6-cue_36
00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:28.556
#Again: electrons, when they were first discovered,

L6-cue_37
00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:32.396
behaved exactly like particles—bullets—very simple.

L6-cue_38
00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:36.296
Further research showed—in electron diffraction experiments,

L6-cue_39
00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:40.056
and so on-that they behaved like waves.

L6-cue_40
00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:44.186
As time went on, there was a growing confusion in the question

L6-cue_41
00:04:44.186 --> 00:04:46.936
of how the things really behaved—waves or particles,

L6-cue_42
00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:50.606
particle or waves—everything looked like both.

L6-cue_43
00:04:50.606 --> 00:04:56.696
#Now, this growing confusion was resolved in 1925 or 1926 with the advent

L6-cue_44
00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.766
of the correct equations for quantum mechanics.

L6-cue_45
00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:07.306
Now we know how the particles—how the electrons and how light—behave, but what can I call it?

L6-cue_46
00:05:07.306 --> 00:05:09.466
I can say they behave like a particle wave,

L6-cue_47
00:05:09.466 --> 00:05:14.736
or they behave in [a] "typical quantum mechanical manner"—there isn’t any word for it.

L6-cue_48
00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:17.826
#If I say they behave like particles, I give the wrong impression; if I say they behave

L6-cue_49
00:05:17.826 --> 00:05:23.076
like waves, they behave in their own inimitable way—which, technically,

L6-cue_50
00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:28.286
could be called the "quantum mechanical way"—they behave in a way that is

L6-cue_51
00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:31.356
like nothing that you have ever seen before!

L6-cue_52
00:05:31.356 --> 00:05:39.666
Your experience with things that you have seen before is inadequate, is incomplete.

L6-cue_53
00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:47.106
The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different: they do not behave just

L6-cue_54
00:05:47.106 --> 00:05:51.306
like particles; they do not behave just like waves.

L6-cue_55
00:05:51.306 --> 00:05:56.996
#Atoms do not behave like weights hanging on a spring and oscillating, nor do they behave

L6-cue_56
00:05:56.996 --> 00:06:00.616
like miniature representations of the solar system, with little planets going

L6-cue_57
00:06:00.616 --> 00:06:04.536
around in orbits, nor does it appear to be somewhat like a cloud

L6-cue_58
00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:11.956
or fog of some sort surrounding a nucleus—it behaves like nothing that you’ve seen before.

L6-cue_59
00:06:11.956 --> 00:06:16.176
#Well, there’s one simplification: at least electrons behave exactly the same,

L6-cue_60
00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:26.466
in this respect, as photons—that is, they’re both screwy, but in exactly the same way.

L6-cue_61
00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:31.776
How they behave, therefore, takes a great deal of imagination to appreciate,

L6-cue_62
00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:37.456
because we are going to describe something which is different than anything you know about.

L6-cue_63
00:06:37.456 --> 00:06:42.366
#This—in that respect at least—makes this perhaps the most difficult lecture of the series,

L6-cue_64
00:06:42.366 --> 00:06:47.776
in the sense that it’s abstract, in the sense that it is not close

L6-cue_65
00:06:47.776 --> 00:06:51.406
to experience-and I cannot avoid that.

L6-cue_66
00:06:51.406 --> 00:06:55.076
I could give a series of lectures on the character of physical law,

L6-cue_67
00:06:55.076 --> 00:07:00.126
and to leave out from this series the description of the actual behavior of particles

L6-cue_68
00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:04.796
on a small scale, I would certainly not be doing the job,

L6-cue_69
00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:08.936
because this thing is completely characteristic of all of the particles of nature,

L6-cue_70
00:07:08.936 --> 00:07:14.606
and is a universal character; it is, if you want to hear about the character of physical law,

L6-cue_71
00:07:14.606 --> 00:07:17.966
essential to talk about this particular aspect.

L6-cue_72
00:07:17.966 --> 00:07:21.816
#So it will be difficult.

L6-cue_73
00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:27.776
But the difficulty, really, is psychological, and exists in the perpetual torment that results

L6-cue_74
00:07:27.776 --> 00:07:34.426
from your saying to yourself, "But how can it be like that!"—which really is a reflection

L6-cue_75
00:07:34.426 --> 00:07:38.816
of an uncontrolled, but I say utterly vain desire, to see it in terms

L6-cue_76
00:07:38.816 --> 00:07:40.976
of some analogy with something familiar.

L6-cue_77
00:07:40.976 --> 00:07:43.166
#I will not describe it in terms of an analogy

L6-cue_78
00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:48.236
with something familiar; I will simply describe it.

L6-cue_79
00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:50.746
#There was a time when the newspaper said

L6-cue_80
00:07:50.746 --> 00:07:53.216
that only twelve men understood the theory of relativity.

L6-cue_81
00:07:53.216 --> 00:07:55.986
I don’t believe there ever was such a time: there might have been of time

L6-cue_82
00:07:55.986 --> 00:08:01.126
when only one man did, because he’s the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper.

L6-cue_83
00:08:01.126 --> 00:08:06.196
But after people read the paper, a lot of people kind of understood the theory of relativity

L6-cue_84
00:08:06.196 --> 00:08:10.056
in some way or other, but more than twelve.

L6-cue_85
00:08:10.056 --> 00:08:16.646
#On the other hand, I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics!

L6-cue_86
00:08:16.646 --> 00:08:19.876
Now, if you appreciate this, and don’t take the lecture too seriously that you really have

L6-cue_87
00:08:19.876 --> 00:08:24.516
to understand, in terms of some model, what I’m going to describe, and just relax and enjoy it,

L6-cue_88
00:08:24.516 --> 00:08:27.476
I’m going to tell you what nature behaves like, and if you will simply admit

L6-cue_89
00:08:27.476 --> 00:08:32.736
that maybe she does behave like this, you will find her a delightful, entrancing thing.

L6-cue_90
00:08:32.736 --> 00:08:35.836
#So that’s the way to look at the lectures—not to try to understand.

L6-cue_91
00:08:35.836 --> 00:08:39.826
(Well, you have to understand the English, of course.)

L6-cue_92
00:08:39.826 --> 00:08:44.626
But, in any sense, in terms of something else, don’t keep saying to yourself,

L6-cue_93
00:08:44.626 --> 00:08:47.086
if you can possibly avoid it, "But how could it be like that!"

L6-cue_94
00:08:47.086 --> 00:08:51.926
Of course, you’ll get down the drain; you’ll get down into a blind alley which nobody has

L6-cue_95
00:08:51.926 --> 00:08:54.956
yet escaped-nobody knows how it can be like that.

L6-cue_96
00:08:54.956 --> 00:09:02.216
#So then just let me describe to you the behavior of electrons, or a photon,

L6-cue_97
00:09:02.216 --> 00:09:04.926
in their typical quantum mechanical way.

L6-cue_98
00:09:04.926 --> 00:09:09.986
Now, the way I’m going to do this is by a mixture of analogy and contrast.

L6-cue_99
00:09:09.986 --> 00:09:15.496
If I made a pure analogy we would fail, so it must be analogy and contrast

L6-cue_100
00:09:15.496 --> 00:09:17.666
to things that you’re familiar with.

L6-cue_101
00:09:17.666 --> 00:09:22.386
#And so I make it, by analogy and contrast, first to the behavior of particles,

L6-cue_102
00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:28.376
for which I will use bullets, and second, to the behavior of waves, for which I will use,

L6-cue_103
00:09:28.376 --> 00:09:31.826
say, water waves, or sound waves.

L6-cue_104
00:09:31.826 --> 00:09:32.646
#So we begin.

L6-cue_105
00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:35.246
First, to discuss in a particular—what I’m going to do is,

L6-cue_106
00:09:35.246 --> 00:09:41.546
I’m going to invent a particular experiment, and first tell how it would behave,

L6-cue_107
00:09:41.546 --> 00:09:45.496
what the situation would be, in that experiment using particles, [then] what you would expect

L6-cue_108
00:09:45.496 --> 00:09:48.906
to happen if waves were involved, and then what happens

L6-cue_109
00:09:48.906 --> 00:09:52.326
when there are actually electrons or photons in the system.

L6-cue_110
00:09:52.326 --> 00:09:58.616
#I will just take this one experiment which has been designed to contain all of the mystery

L6-cue_111
00:09:58.616 --> 00:10:03.026
of quantum mechanics to put you up against the paradoxes and mysteries

L6-cue_112
00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:06.156
and peculiarities of nature 100 percent.

L6-cue_113
00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:12.416
Any other situation in quantum mechanics, it turns out, can always be explained afterwards

L6-cue_114
00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:16.806
by saying, "You remember the case of the experiment with the two holes?

L6-cue_115
00:10:16.806 --> 00:10:18.256
It’s the same thing."

L6-cue_116
00:10:18.256 --> 00:10:21.636
#So I’m going to tell you about the experiment with the two holes,

L6-cue_117
00:10:21.636 --> 00:10:25.926
which is the general mystery: it contains, it does contain,

L6-cue_118
00:10:25.926 --> 00:10:28.186
the general mystery; I am avoiding nothing.

L6-cue_119
00:10:28.186 --> 00:10:35.856
I am baring nature in her most elegant and difficult form.

L6-cue_120
00:10:35.856 --> 00:10:36.976
#So you start with bullets.

L6-cue_121
00:10:36.976 --> 00:10:42.756
All the experiments are going to be in the same general design, so I’ll draw it this way:

L6-cue_122
00:10:42.756 --> 00:10:47.466
suppose that we have some source of bullets, which just represents the source,

L6-cue_123
00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:54.556
which we call "the source"—and is, in fact, in the case of bullets, a machine gun.

L6-cue_124
00:10:54.556 --> 00:10:58.876
Then we have a plate in front here, with a hole in it for the bullets to come out of,

L6-cue_125
00:10:58.876 --> 00:11:02.226
and this plate, in the case of bullets, is armor plate.

L6-cue_126
00:11:02.226 --> 00:11:09.396
Then a long distance from here we have another plate, which I’m drawing only a short distance,

L6-cue_127
00:11:09.396 --> 00:11:13.286
because I haven’t got room on the blackboard for everything, but this distance is supposed

L6-cue_128
00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:16.276
to be much longer in proportion to the width.

L6-cue_129
00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:20.566
#Please expand that; that’s a small point, and it has two holes

L6-cue_130
00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:23.686
in it—that’s the famous "two—hole" business.

L6-cue_131
00:11:23.686 --> 00:11:26.866
#I’m going to talk a lot about these holes, so I’ll talk about this hole

L6-cue_132
00:11:26.866 --> 00:11:30.356
as Number 1 Hole, and the other hole as Number 2.

L6-cue_133
00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.886
And I’m only drawing it in two dimensions.

L6-cue_134
00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:37.726
You can, if you wish, imagine these as round holes in three dimensions,

L6-cue_135
00:11:37.726 --> 00:11:40.256
but just say it’s a cross section.

L6-cue_136
00:11:40.256 --> 00:11:44.166
#And then again, a long distance away (but we’ll draw it relatively short distance,

L6-cue_137
00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:48.876
because of the limitations of this blackboard), we have another screen here,

L6-cue_138
00:11:48.876 --> 00:11:53.676
which is just a backstop of some sort, into and on which we can put

L6-cue_139
00:11:53.676 --> 00:11:58.736
in various places what I will call a detector—I’m going to mark

L6-cue_140
00:11:58.736 --> 00:12:03.506
that "detector"—which, in the case of the bullets,

L6-cue_141
00:12:03.506 --> 00:12:07.346
is a box of sand into which the bullets will be caught,

L6-cue_142
00:12:07.346 --> 00:12:12.606
and we can count them—that’s the detector for bullets.

L6-cue_143
00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:17.306
#I don’t want to have to redraw the experiment each time so I’ll label everything in this way,

L6-cue_144
00:12:17.306 --> 00:12:22.786
and then we’ll be able to catch on to situations for different cases.

L6-cue_145
00:12:22.786 --> 00:12:27.356
Also, I’m going to do experiments in which I count how many bullets come into this detector,

L6-cue_146
00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:32.316
or box of sand, when the box is here, or here, or here, or here; and to describe that,

L6-cue_147
00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:37.526
I’ll measure the distance of the box from somewhere out here, and call that X—and I talk

L6-cue_148
00:12:37.526 --> 00:12:41.736
about what happens when we change X: it means only you move the doggone thing up and down.

L6-cue_149
00:12:41.736 --> 00:12:43.396
#All right.

L6-cue_150
00:12:43.396 --> 00:12:49.916
#Now first, I would like to make a few modifications from real bullets

L6-cue_151
00:12:49.916 --> 00:12:53.636
into idealizations: the first is, the machine gun is very shaky and wobbly,

L6-cue_152
00:12:53.636 --> 00:12:58.946
and that the bullets go in various directions, not just exactly straight on and bounce back,

L6-cue_153
00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:02.536
and they can ricochet off the edges of the slips—the slits,

L6-cue_154
00:13:02.536 --> 00:13:06.336
rather-the holes in these armor plates.

L6-cue_155
00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:11.636
#Let’s say, for instance, that the bullets have all the same speed or energy,

L6-cue_156
00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:15.346
if you want (but that’s not very important), but the most important idealization

L6-cue_157
00:13:15.346 --> 00:13:20.666
in which it differs from real bullets is: I want these bullets to be absolutely indestructible,

L6-cue_158
00:13:20.666 --> 00:13:24.726
so that what we find in the box is not pieces of lead of some bullet that broke

L6-cue_159
00:13:24.726 --> 00:13:27.076
in half; we get the whole bullet, please.

L6-cue_160
00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:34.456
So imagine indestructible bullets, or hard bullets and soft armor plate, or something.

L6-cue_161
00:13:34.456 --> 00:13:40.736
#Now, the first thing that we will notice about bullets is that the things that arrive come

L6-cue_162
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:46.886
in lumps: when the energy comes, it’s all in one bullet—full of bang.

L6-cue_163
00:13:46.886 --> 00:13:51.916
If you count the bullets, there’s 1, 2, 3, 4 bullets—the things come in lumps;

L6-cue_164
00:13:51.916 --> 00:13:55.186
they’re equal in size, we suppose, in this case.

L6-cue_165
00:13:55.186 --> 00:13:57.726
When a thing comes into the box, it’s either all in the box

L6-cue_166
00:13:57.726 --> 00:14:00.546
or it’s not in the box—it comes in lumps.

L6-cue_167
00:14:00.546 --> 00:14:06.586
#More: if I put up two boxes here, I never get two bullets in the boxes at the same time.

L6-cue_168
00:14:06.586 --> 00:14:12.436
(Well—if the gun isn’t going off too fast and I have enough time between—slow down the gun

L6-cue_169
00:14:12.436 --> 00:14:17.726
so they go off very slowly, bing, bing—bing, bing—then put the two things here,

L6-cue_170
00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:22.876
and look very quickly in the two boxes, you’ll never get two bullets at the time

L6-cue_171
00:14:22.876 --> 00:14:27.816
in the two boxes, because a bullet is a single identifiable lump.)

L6-cue_172
00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:32.426
I call that characteristic of the object that it comes in lumps.

L6-cue_173
00:14:32.426 --> 00:14:43.536
#The first thing about bullets is that they come in lumps.

L6-cue_174
00:14:43.536 --> 00:14:46.546
Now, what I’m going to measure is how many bullets arrive here

L6-cue_175
00:14:46.546 --> 00:14:49.716
on the average in a long period of time.

L6-cue_176
00:14:49.716 --> 00:14:51.706
Say you wait an hour, and you count how many bullets are

L6-cue_177
00:14:51.706 --> 00:14:56.456
in the can-in the sand-and average that.

L6-cue_178
00:14:56.456 --> 00:15:03.056
#Now, we call that, if you want per—let’s say we take a definite time, like, per hour,

L6-cue_179
00:15:03.056 --> 00:15:06.906
and say the number of bullets that arrive per hour, and sometimes you could call

L6-cue_180
00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.696
that what’s called the probability of arrival, because it just gives the chance

L6-cue_181
00:15:10.696 --> 00:15:13.036
that a bullet going through this thing arrives

L6-cue_182
00:15:13.036 --> 00:15:16.056
in this particular box—at least it’s proportionate to the chance.

L6-cue_183
00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:18.306
#One way to measure is to measure the average number of bullets

L6-cue_184
00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:21.166
that arrive over a period of time.

L6-cue_185
00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:26.746
Now, the number of bullets that arrive in this box here will vary as I vary X:

L6-cue_186
00:15:26.746 --> 00:15:33.176
I’m going to make a graph here in which I plot horizontally the number of bullets that I get

L6-cue_187
00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:35.336
if I hold this thing here for an hour.

L6-cue_188
00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:41.086
I’ll get a curve that will probably look more or less like this

L6-cue_189
00:15:41.086 --> 00:15:47.346
because when the box is behind one of these holes, it gets a lot of bullets—it gets the ones

L6-cue_190
00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:50.616
that went through this hole—and otherwise it gets in the one through this hole,

L6-cue_191
00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:53.486
and if it’s a little bit out of line it doesn’t get as many (they have

L6-cue_192
00:15:53.486 --> 00:15:58.066
to bounce a little off the edges of the hole, and so it disappears like this).

L6-cue_193
00:15:58.066 --> 00:16:03.166
#This is the number that we get in an hour when both holes are open.

L6-cue_194
00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:08.876
I call that by an abbreviation, N—1—2, which merely means the number which arrives

L6-cue_195
00:16:08.876 --> 00:16:12.226
when Hole Number 1 and Hole Number 2 are both open.

L6-cue_196
00:16:12.226 --> 00:16:15.406
Looks like that, say.

L6-cue_197
00:16:15.406 --> 00:16:20.096
#Now, I must insist that the number that we’re plotting here doesn’t come in lumps;

L6-cue_198
00:16:20.096 --> 00:16:24.916
it can have any size it wants—for example, there can be two and a half bullets in an hour.

L6-cue_199
00:16:24.916 --> 00:16:28.226
In spite of the fact that the bullets come in lumps, what I mean by two and a half bullets

L6-cue_200
00:16:28.226 --> 00:16:32.366
in an hour is, that if you run a long time, like 10 hours, you get 25 bullets,

L6-cue_201
00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.816
so it’s on the average two and a half bullets.

L6-cue_202
00:16:34.816 --> 00:16:38.266
The N can have any size; it doesn’t have to be in lumps because it’s an average.

L6-cue_203
00:16:38.266 --> 00:16:41.916
#I’m sure you’re all familiar with the joke about the fact that the average family

L6-cue_204
00:16:41.916 --> 00:16:45.706
in the United States seems to have two and a half children.

L6-cue_205
00:16:45.706 --> 00:16:50.626
It doesn’t mean that there’s a half a child in any family whatever; the children come in lumps.

L6-cue_206
00:16:50.626 --> 00:16:56.046
But nevertheless, when you take the average number per family,

L6-cue_207
00:16:56.046 --> 00:16:57.546
it can be any number whatsoever.

L6-cue_208
00:16:57.546 --> 00:17:01.976
#And so this number N, which is the number that will arrive in this container per hour

L6-cue_209
00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:06.416
on the average, need not be an integer—it can be a tenth,

L6-cue_210
00:17:06.416 --> 00:17:09.276
which would mean under those circumstances that you’d have to wait

L6-cue_211
00:17:09.276 --> 00:17:16.066
on the average 10 hours, more or less, per bullet.

L6-cue_212
00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:19.586
What we measure, then, is the probability of arrival,

L6-cue_213
00:17:19.586 --> 00:17:24.716
which is a technical measure, the probability of arrival.

L6-cue_214
00:17:24.716 --> 00:17:32.896
It is a technical term, really, for the average number that arrive in a given length of time.

L6-cue_215
00:17:32.896 --> 00:17:38.876
#Now, finally, if we go to analyze this curve N—1—2, we can interpret it very nicely:

L6-cue_216
00:17:38.876 --> 00:17:42.726
we can interpret it as a sum of two curves, which I will draw here.

L6-cue_217
00:17:42.726 --> 00:17:47.886
(That’s why I need the blackboard where I’ve got several cases, so I draw two curves here.)

L6-cue_218
00:17:47.886 --> 00:17:51.176
One which would represent what I’ll call N—1.

L6-cue_219
00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:57.146
The number which would come if Hole Number 2 is closed by another piece of armor plate in front,

L6-cue_220
00:17:57.146 --> 00:17:59.426
and so they all come through Number 1.

L6-cue_221
00:17:59.426 --> 00:18:04.816
N-2 would be the number that come through Hole Number 2 alone.

L6-cue_222
00:18:04.816 --> 00:18:08.466
So N—1 is the number that come through Hole Number 1 alone, and N—2 is the number that come

L6-cue_223
00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:12.556
through Hole Number 2 alone, those numbers being determined by closing the respective holes.

L6-cue_224
00:18:12.556 --> 00:18:16.926
#Then we discover a very important law, which is that the number that arrive

L6-cue_225
00:18:16.926 --> 00:18:19.276
with both holes open is the number that arrive by coming

L6-cue_226
00:18:19.276 --> 00:18:23.656
through Number 1 Hole plus the number that come through Number 2 Hole.

L6-cue_227
00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:25.576
This proposition-the fact that all you have

L6-cue_228
00:18:25.576 --> 00:18:31.586
to do is add these two together—I’d call "nice," or "no interference."

L6-cue_229
00:18:31.586 --> 00:18:36.426
That is, what you get from the two holes open is the same as you’d get

L6-cue_230
00:18:36.426 --> 00:18:39.666
by simply adding each hole separately.

L6-cue_231
00:18:39.666 --> 00:18:40.396
That’s for bullets.

L6-cue_232
00:18:40.396 --> 00:18:43.866
#Done-we’re done with bullets.

L6-cue_233
00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:44.226
#All right.

L6-cue_234
00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:48.636
I begin again, this time with water waves.

L6-cue_235
00:18:48.636 --> 00:18:54.626
Here is standing some kind of a big mass of stuff which is being shaken up and down.

L6-cue_236
00:18:54.626 --> 00:19:01.346
This is a long line of barges, or jetties, with a gap in the water inbetween.

L6-cue_237
00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:03.296
(Perhaps it’s better to do it with ripples than it is to do it

L6-cue_238
00:19:03.296 --> 00:19:05.246
with big ocean waves; it sounds more sensible.)

L6-cue_239
00:19:05.246 --> 00:19:08.796
I wiggle my finger up and down here, and I have a little piece of wood here,

L6-cue_240
00:19:08.796 --> 00:19:13.926
and ripples start out here, and then I’ve arranged in a tank to put boards in the way here

L6-cue_241
00:19:13.926 --> 00:19:18.786
so that I have these two holes, and then I have this so—called detector.

L6-cue_242
00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:23.546
#Then what I do with the detector—what the detector detects is how much the water is

L6-cue_243
00:19:23.546 --> 00:19:28.436
jiggling: for instance, I put a cork in the water and measure how it moves up and down.

L6-cue_244
00:19:28.436 --> 00:19:33.166
What I’m going to measure, in fact, is the energy of the agitation of the cork,

L6-cue_245
00:19:33.166 --> 00:19:41.146
which is exactly proportional to the energy carried by the waves.

L6-cue_246
00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:45.076
#Also, I forgot to say that this jiggling is made very regular and perfect,

L6-cue_247
00:19:45.076 --> 00:19:48.556
so that the waves are all of the same spacing from one another,

L6-cue_248
00:19:48.556 --> 00:19:52.606
and then I’ll describe what we get under those circumstances.

L6-cue_249
00:19:52.606 --> 00:20:02.026
#For that, I first remark—well, let’s see: first we can measure the energy of the cork.

L6-cue_250
00:20:02.026 --> 00:20:07.696
But then another thing is important for light, or for water waves—for waves,

L6-cue_251
00:20:07.696 --> 00:20:14.076
water waves—is that the thing that we’re measuring can have any size at all:

L6-cue_252
00:20:14.076 --> 00:20:17.466
we’re measuring the intensity of the waves, or the energy in the cork;

L6-cue_253
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:22.436
if the waves are very quiet, if the fellow over here is only jiggling a little bit,

L6-cue_254
00:20:22.436 --> 00:20:23.756
then there will be very little motion

L6-cue_255
00:20:23.756 --> 00:20:26.626
to the cork-no matter how much it is, it’s proportional.

L6-cue_256
00:20:26.626 --> 00:20:34.436
So I can have any size.

L6-cue_257
00:20:34.436 --> 00:20:37.696
It doesn’t come in lumps, it’s not all there or nothing.

L6-cue_258
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:46.986
#What we’re going to measure is the intensity of the waves, which to be precise, if you want,

L6-cue_259
00:20:46.986 --> 00:20:51.976
is the energy generated by the waves at a point.

L6-cue_260
00:20:51.976 --> 00:20:57.186
Now, what happens if we measure the intensity, which I’ll draw on a third curve here,

L6-cue_261
00:20:57.186 --> 00:21:00.726
which I’ll call "I"-to remind you it’s an intensity, and not a number of particles

L6-cue_262
00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:10.316
of any kind, and I-1-2 when both holes are open—is a curve that looks something like this:

L6-cue_263
00:21:10.316 --> 00:21:14.936
another interesting, complicated—looking curve, which ought to be symmetrical.

L6-cue_264
00:21:14.936 --> 00:21:19.846
#(I didn’t do too badly, actually.)

L6-cue_265
00:21:19.846 --> 00:21:21.566
#A very complicated—looking curve.

L6-cue_266
00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:24.806
That is, if we put the [detector] in different places, we get a very, very different intensity

L6-cue_267
00:21:24.806 --> 00:21:28.096
which varies very rapidly in a peculiar manner.

L6-cue_268
00:21:28.096 --> 00:21:30.866
You’re probably all familiar with the reason for that.

L6-cue_269
00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:35.466
The reason is that the ripples, as they come out of here, have crests and troughs spreading

L6-cue_270
00:21:35.466 --> 00:21:39.206
from here, and they have crests and troughs spreading from here.

L6-cue_271
00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:45.506
#Now, if we’re at a place which, say, is exactly even between these two things

L6-cue_272
00:21:45.506 --> 00:21:50.136
so that the two waves arrive at the same time, the crests will come on top of each other

L6-cue_273
00:21:50.136 --> 00:21:59.826
and there’ll be plenty of jiggling, which is the exact opposite of this curve—so I’ll have

L6-cue_274
00:21:59.826 --> 00:22:03.176
to put-there should be another bump.

L6-cue_275
00:22:03.176 --> 00:22:07.776
You have a lot of jiggling right in dead center.

L6-cue_276
00:22:07.776 --> 00:22:13.596
#On the other hand, if I were to move to some point here, since I’m further from Hole 2

L6-cue_277
00:22:13.596 --> 00:22:19.346
than Hole 1, it takes a little longer for the waves to come from 2 than from 1.

L6-cue_278
00:22:19.346 --> 00:22:24.916
When 1 has a crest arriving, the crest hasn’t quite reached there yet from 2—in fact,

L6-cue_279
00:22:24.916 --> 00:22:30.106
it’s a trough from 2—so that water tries to move up, and it tries to move down,

L6-cue_280
00:22:30.106 --> 00:22:34.756
from the influences of the waves coming from the two holes, and the net result is it doesn’t move

L6-cue_281
00:22:34.756 --> 00:22:39.466
at all, or practically not at all, and so we have these low bumps at that place.

L6-cue_282
00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:45.386
And then if you move still further over, you get enough delay that when a crest is here,

L6-cue_283
00:22:45.386 --> 00:22:51.196
this other crest is one whole wave behind, so it’s a crest that—two crests are coming on top

L6-cue_284
00:22:51.196 --> 00:22:54.016
of each other, but not the same crest, so to speak.

L6-cue_285
00:22:54.016 --> 00:22:58.276
#The fourth crest from here, and the fifth crest from there on top, so you get a big one again,

L6-cue_286
00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:01.446
then a small one, a big one, a small one, depending upon the way the crests

L6-cue_287
00:23:01.446 --> 00:23:04.986
and troughs interfere, as we say.

L6-cue_288
00:23:04.986 --> 00:23:09.416
#The word "interference," again, is used in science in a funny way,

L6-cue_289
00:23:09.416 --> 00:23:13.976
because we’ll have what we call "constructive interference":

L6-cue_290
00:23:13.976 --> 00:23:17.676
when they both interfere here, it makes it stronger.

L6-cue_291
00:23:17.676 --> 00:23:22.366
Well, they call it interference anyway, but the very important thing is

L6-cue_292
00:23:22.366 --> 00:23:29.626
that I-1-2 is not the same as I-1 plus I-2, and we say it shows interference—yes, interference;

L6-cue_293
00:23:29.626 --> 00:23:36.216
that’s a funny term, we use it—constructive and destructive interference.

L6-cue_294
00:23:36.216 --> 00:23:38.266
#I didn’t mention what I-1 and I-2 look like,

L6-cue_295
00:23:38.266 --> 00:23:42.046
but we can find out by closing this, for instance, to find I-1.

L6-cue_296
00:23:42.046 --> 00:23:48.836
The intensity that you get here, if the hole is closed, is simply the waves from one hole,

L6-cue_297
00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:51.236
for which there’s no interference, and that’s this curve.

L6-cue_298
00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:54.076
N-1 is the same as I-1, and the same way, otherwise,

L6-cue_299
00:23:54.076 --> 00:23:57.816
I-2—and this curve is quite different than the sum of these two.

L6-cue_300
00:23:57.816 --> 00:24:01.596
#As a matter of fact, the mathematics of this curve is rather an interesting one.

L6-cue_301
00:24:01.596 --> 00:24:07.246
What is true is this: that the height of the water, when both holes are open,

L6-cue_302
00:24:07.246 --> 00:24:10.316
is equal to the height that you would get from Number 1 open,

L6-cue_303
00:24:10.316 --> 00:24:12.796
plus the height that you would get from Number 2 open.

L6-cue_304
00:24:12.796 --> 00:24:17.596
#Thus, if it’s a trough, the height from 2 is negative, and cancels out the height from 1.

L6-cue_305
00:24:17.596 --> 00:24:20.666
#So you can represent it by talking about the height of the water,

L6-cue_306
00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:23.656
but it turns out that the intensity, in any case (for instance,

L6-cue_307
00:24:23.656 --> 00:24:29.616
when both holes are open) is not the same as the height, but it’s proportional to the square

L6-cue_308
00:24:29.616 --> 00:24:33.896
of the height, and it’s because of this fact, that we’re dealing with the squares,

L6-cue_309
00:24:33.896 --> 00:24:38.026
that we get these very interesting curves.

L6-cue_310
00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:38.836
#All right.

L6-cue_311
00:24:38.836 --> 00:24:49.366
#Now we erase the machinery and start over; this time we start with electrons.

L6-cue_312
00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:53.626
We have a filament here, tungsten plate, holes in the tungsten plate,

L6-cue_313
00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:57.846
and for a detector any electrical system which is sufficiently sensitive to pick up the charge

L6-cue_314
00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:02.316
of an electron arriving with whatever energy the source has.

L6-cue_315
00:25:02.316 --> 00:25:06.726
#Or, if you would prefer, we could use photons: this is a black paper with a hole in it,

L6-cue_316
00:25:06.726 --> 00:25:09.806
two holes in another sheet of black paper (paper isn’t very good,

L6-cue_317
00:25:09.806 --> 00:25:14.446
because the fibers don’t make a sharp hole, so use something better), and here, for a detector,

L6-cue_318
00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:19.126
a photomultiplier that can detect the individual photons arriving.

L6-cue_319
00:25:19.126 --> 00:25:22.226
#Now, what happens with either case—and I’ll discuss only the electron case;

L6-cue_320
00:25:22.226 --> 00:25:27.026
the other case is exactly the same, the case with photons—is this: first,

L6-cue_321
00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:30.156
that what we receive in this electrical detector,

L6-cue_322
00:25:30.156 --> 00:25:34.986
with a sufficiently powerful amplifier behind it, are clicks.

L6-cue_323
00:25:34.986 --> 00:25:43.096
Click, click-click-click, and so on, with the source here—lumps, absolutely lumps:

L6-cue_324
00:25:43.096 --> 00:25:46.216
when the click comes it’s a certain size, and the size is the same.

L6-cue_325
00:25:46.216 --> 00:25:51.766
#If you turn the source weaker, the clicks come further apart, but it’s the same size click.

L6-cue_326
00:25:51.766 --> 00:25:54.436
If you turn it up, they go click- click-click-click-click,

L6-cue_327
00:25:54.436 --> 00:25:59.506
and it jams the amplifier-you have to turn it down enough that there aren’t too many clicks

L6-cue_328
00:25:59.506 --> 00:26:01.746
for the machinery that you’re using to detect.

L6-cue_329
00:26:01.746 --> 00:26:07.536
#Next, if you were to put up another detector here, and listen to both of them,

L6-cue_330
00:26:07.536 --> 00:26:11.446
you’d never get two clicks at the same time (at least if the source is weak enough)

L6-cue_331
00:26:11.446 --> 00:26:15.826
because of the precision with which you measure the same time: if you cut down the intensity

L6-cue_332
00:26:15.826 --> 00:26:21.156
of the source so they come few and far between, they never come a click in both detectors.

L6-cue_333
00:26:21.156 --> 00:26:25.966
#That means that the thing which is coming, comes in lumps: it has a definite size,

L6-cue_334
00:26:25.966 --> 00:26:29.176
and it only comes to one place at a time.

L6-cue_335
00:26:29.176 --> 00:26:44.136
#All right, so for electrons—or for photons, we’ll just use electrons—it comes in lumps.

L6-cue_336
00:26:44.136 --> 00:26:48.216
#Therefore, what we can do is the same thing as we did with the bullets:

L6-cue_337
00:26:48.216 --> 00:26:52.516
we measure how many come; we measure the probability of arrival.

L6-cue_338
00:26:52.516 --> 00:26:57.226
What we do is we hold the detector in a certain place.

L6-cue_339
00:26:57.226 --> 00:27:00.916
(Actually, if we wanted to, although it’s expensive, we could put detectors all

L6-cue_340
00:27:00.916 --> 00:27:04.586
over at the same time, and make the whole curve simultaneously.)

L6-cue_341
00:27:04.586 --> 00:27:07.006
#But let’s suppose we put it at a certain place, and we measure at the end

L6-cue_342
00:27:07.006 --> 00:27:11.746
of an hour how many electrons came, and we average it.

L6-cue_343
00:27:11.746 --> 00:27:16.426
(By the way, if I put detectors all along the back here, when one comes it comes into one,

L6-cue_344
00:27:16.426 --> 00:27:19.186
but not [into] others: it’s just one goes off, then the other goes off, and this goes off,

L6-cue_345
00:27:19.186 --> 00:27:22.606
and that one goes off, and so on—just like with bullets.)

L6-cue_346
00:27:22.606 --> 00:27:26.126
#We measure, then, the probability of arrival of the electrons.

L6-cue_347
00:27:26.126 --> 00:27:29.056
And what do we get?

L6-cue_348
00:27:29.056 --> 00:27:33.196
The number of electrons that arrive—the same kind of an N-1-2 as before.

L6-cue_349
00:27:33.196 --> 00:27:41.356
This is what we get for N-1-2.

L6-cue_350
00:27:41.356 --> 00:27:46.656
N-1-2, this is what we get with both holes open!

L6-cue_351
00:27:46.656 --> 00:27:51.576
#That’s the phenomena of nature: that she produces the curve which is the same

L6-cue_352
00:27:51.576 --> 00:27:56.046
as you would get from an interference of waves.

L6-cue_353
00:27:56.046 --> 00:27:57.136
#But she produces a curve for what?

L6-cue_354
00:27:57.136 --> 00:28:02.286
Not for the energy in a way but for the probability of arrival of one of these lumps.

L6-cue_355
00:28:02.286 --> 00:28:03.686
The mathematics is simple.

L6-cue_356
00:28:03.686 --> 00:28:08.726
You change I to N, and you have to change H to something else, which is new,

L6-cue_357
00:28:08.726 --> 00:28:11.926
and you call it something, because it’s not the height of anything,

L6-cue_358
00:28:11.926 --> 00:28:16.826
but it in order [to express this] curve as a simple mathematical form, there’s an A,

L6-cue_359
00:28:16.826 --> 00:28:19.926
which can be represented as an A-1 plus an A-2,

L6-cue_360
00:28:19.926 --> 00:28:23.546
which we call a probability amplitude (because we don’t know what it means), which,

L6-cue_361
00:28:23.546 --> 00:28:28.226
to arrive from Hole 1, plus the probability amplitude to arrive from Hole 2,

L6-cue_362
00:28:28.226 --> 00:28:33.616
and you add the two together to get the total probability amplitude to arrive, and square it.

L6-cue_363
00:28:33.616 --> 00:28:37.006
#It’s a direct imitation of what happens with the waves, because we’ve got to get the same curve

L6-cue_364
00:28:37.006 --> 00:28:43.096
out so we use the same mathematics.

L6-cue_365
00:28:43.096 --> 00:28:47.396
#Let’s find out if-I’d better check on one point, though, about the interference:

L6-cue_366
00:28:47.396 --> 00:28:50.506
I forgot to say what happens if we close one of the holes.

L6-cue_367
00:28:50.506 --> 00:28:56.636
Let’s try to analyze this interesting curve, which now, for electrons (I erase all the stuff

L6-cue_368
00:28:56.636 --> 00:29:02.756
with the light, so everything with light is erased, and now we’re talking about electrons;

L6-cue_369
00:29:02.756 --> 00:29:07.766
this curve isn’t important in our case) this is the number which arrives.

L6-cue_370
00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:17.276
#Now, we would like to analyze this curve.

L6-cue_371
00:29:17.276 --> 00:29:22.996
We try this: we say, "Maybe it comes—we can analyze this—by thinking that the electrons come

L6-cue_372
00:29:22.996 --> 00:29:26.626
through this hole or through the other"—so we can close one hole and measure how many come

L6-cue_373
00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:30.836
through Hole Number 1, and we get that curve; or, we can close this hole,

L6-cue_374
00:29:30.836 --> 00:29:34.636
and measure how many come through Hole Number 2, and we get that curve.

L6-cue_375
00:29:34.636 --> 00:29:38.406
These two added together is not this, and so this is not the same

L6-cue_376
00:29:38.406 --> 00:29:47.166
as N-1 plus N-2—it does show interference; it shows interference.

L6-cue_377
00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:51.656
#And in fact the mathematics is given by this funny formula that the probability

L6-cue_378
00:29:51.656 --> 00:30:02.396
of arrival is the square of an amplitude, which itself is the sum of two pieces.

L6-cue_379
00:30:02.396 --> 00:30:07.506
Now, nobody-a question is, how can that come about, that when they go through Hole 1,

L6-cue_380
00:30:07.506 --> 00:30:10.436
they would be distributed this way; when they go through Hole 2, they would be distributed

L6-cue_381
00:30:10.436 --> 00:30:15.476
that way; how could it be that when both holes are open, you don’t get the sum of the two?

L6-cue_382
00:30:15.476 --> 00:30:20.936
#Instance: if I hold the detector at this point here, I get practically nothing.

L6-cue_383
00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:25.506
If I close one of the holes, I get plenty.

L6-cue_384
00:30:25.506 --> 00:30:28.776
If I close the other hole, I get something.

L6-cue_385
00:30:28.776 --> 00:30:33.186
If I leave both holes open, I get nothing—if I let them go

L6-cue_386
00:30:33.186 --> 00:30:35.976
through both holes, they don’t come anymore.

L6-cue_387
00:30:35.976 --> 00:30:40.436
#Or take the point in the center: you can show that that’s higher than the sum that it was

L6-cue_388
00:30:40.436 --> 00:30:44.856
in the other case, than the sum of these two; I get more here when both holes are open,

L6-cue_389
00:30:44.856 --> 00:30:47.126
than I would get with either one of the two closed.

L6-cue_390
00:30:47.126 --> 00:30:50.606
#Now you might think that if you were clever enough, you could argue that they have some way

L6-cue_391
00:30:50.606 --> 00:30:53.536
of going around through the holes, back and forth, and they do something complicated,

L6-cue_392
00:30:53.536 --> 00:30:56.506
or it splits in half and goes through the two holes, and so forth,

L6-cue_393
00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.646
in order to explain this phenomenon.

L6-cue_394
00:30:58.646 --> 00:31:04.986
#Nobody, however, has succeeded to get an explanation of this that’s satisfactory,

L6-cue_395
00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:09.306
because the mathematics in the end is so very simple—the curve is so very simple.

L6-cue_396
00:31:09.306 --> 00:31:16.206
#I will summarize, then, by saying that electrons arrive in lumps, like particles.

L6-cue_397
00:31:16.206 --> 00:31:22.966
But the probability of arrival of these lumps is determined like the intensity of waves would be.

L6-cue_398
00:31:22.966 --> 00:31:29.836
It is in this sense that the electron behaves, as you might say, sometimes like a particle,

L6-cue_399
00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:32.446
and sometimes like a wave; it behaves in these two different ways

L6-cue_400
00:31:32.446 --> 00:31:35.486
at the same time-that’s all there is to say.

L6-cue_401
00:31:35.486 --> 00:31:39.696
#I give a mathematical description to figure out the probability of arrival of electrons

L6-cue_402
00:31:39.696 --> 00:31:45.826
on any circumstances, and that would, in principle, be the end of the lecture-except

L6-cue_403
00:31:45.826 --> 00:31:50.896
that there are a number of subtleties involved in the fact that nature works this way;

L6-cue_404
00:31:50.896 --> 00:31:58.546
there’s a number of peculiar things, and I would like to discuss those peculiarities,

L6-cue_405
00:31:58.546 --> 00:32:01.286
because they may not be self—evident at this point.

L6-cue_406
00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:05.866
#To discuss the subtleties, we begin by discussing a proposition

L6-cue_407
00:32:05.866 --> 00:32:10.056
which we would have thought to use since these things are lumps:

L6-cue_408
00:32:10.056 --> 00:32:14.996
since what comes is always one complete "p ah" (which I’ll call an electron—one complete lump,

L6-cue_409
00:32:14.996 --> 00:32:20.386
one complete electron), it’s obvious that it’s reasonable

L6-cue_410
00:32:20.386 --> 00:32:31.026
that either an electron arrives—or goes, let’s say—that either an electron goes

L6-cue_411
00:32:31.026 --> 00:32:39.296
through Hole Number 1, or it goes through Hole Number 2.

L6-cue_412
00:32:39.296 --> 00:32:39.916
#That seems like .

L6-cue_413
00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:46.676
. . that seems very obvious that it can’t do anything else if it’s a lump.

L6-cue_414
00:32:46.676 --> 00:32:50.806
#I’m going to discuss this proposition, so I have to give it a name;

L6-cue_415
00:32:50.806 --> 00:32:55.466
I’ll call it Proposition A. Now, we’ve already discussed a little bit what happens

L6-cue_416
00:32:55.466 --> 00:32:59.266
with Proposition A. If it were true that an electron either goes through Hole Number 1

L6-cue_417
00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:03.936
or it goes through Hole Number 2, then the total number which arrive here would have

L6-cue_418
00:33:03.936 --> 00:33:08.696
to be analyzable as the sum of two contributions—the total number

L6-cue_419
00:33:08.696 --> 00:33:12.736
which arrive here will be the number that come here via Hole 1 plus the number

L6-cue_420
00:33:12.736 --> 00:33:18.646
that come via Hole 2—and since this curve cannot easily be analyzed as the sum of two pieces

L6-cue_421
00:33:18.646 --> 00:33:22.096
in such a nice manner, and since the experiments

L6-cue_422
00:33:22.096 --> 00:33:27.226
which determine how many would have arriven—would have arrived—if only Hole Number 1

L6-cue_423
00:33:27.226 --> 00:33:32.436
were open don’t give the result that this number is the sum of these two,

L6-cue_424
00:33:32.436 --> 00:33:38.126
it is obvious that we should conclude that this Proposition is false—it is not true,

L6-cue_425
00:33:38.126 --> 00:33:41.876
that the electron either comes through Hole Number 1 or Hole Number 2;

L6-cue_426
00:33:41.876 --> 00:33:45.326
maybe [the electron] divides itself in half temporarily, and so on.

L6-cue_427
00:33:45.326 --> 00:33:47.476
#So Proposition A is false.

L6-cue_428
00:33:47.476 --> 00:33:48.616
#That’s logic.

L6-cue_429
00:33:48.616 --> 00:33:55.476
#Unfortunately (or otherwise), we can test logic by experiment, and so we just have to do—to find

L6-cue_430
00:33:55.476 --> 00:34:00.376
out whether it’s true or not that the electrons come through Hole 1 and Hole 2 (or maybe they go

L6-cue_431
00:34:00.376 --> 00:34:02.616
around through both holes, or they split up, and so on).

L6-cue_432
00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:05.846
. . —all we have to do is watch them.

L6-cue_433
00:34:05.846 --> 00:34:07.696
#To watch them we need light.

L6-cue_434
00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:14.146
So we put back here, behind the holes, a source of light—very intense light.

L6-cue_435
00:34:14.146 --> 00:34:17.916
Light is scattered by electrons; it’s bounced off electrons—in other words,

L6-cue_436
00:34:17.916 --> 00:34:20.356
you can see electrons as they go by if the light’s strong enough.

L6-cue_437
00:34:20.356 --> 00:34:26.406
#We stand back here, and we look to see whether we see, when the electron is counted here,

L6-cue_438
00:34:26.406 --> 00:34:31.476
a flash-or have seen, the moment before the electron is counted here, a flash behind Hole 1,

L6-cue_439
00:34:31.476 --> 00:34:36.076
or a flash behind Hole 2, or maybe a sort of "half flash" in each place

L6-cue_440
00:34:36.076 --> 00:34:41.416
at the same time—because we’re going to find out, now, how it goes, by looking!

L6-cue_441
00:34:41.416 --> 00:34:43.926
#Well, you turn on the light and look.

L6-cue_442
00:34:43.926 --> 00:34:48.506
And lo, you discover that you see flashes behind either one hole

L6-cue_443
00:34:48.506 --> 00:34:51.496
or the other hole every time you get a count here.

L6-cue_444
00:34:51.496 --> 00:34:55.766
Every time there’s a count here, you see a flash behind Number 1, or behind Number 2.

L6-cue_445
00:34:55.766 --> 00:35:00.866
#What you see is that the electron comes 100 percent complete

L6-cue_446
00:35:00.866 --> 00:35:04.066
through Hole 1 or through Hole 2—when you look.

L6-cue_447
00:35:04.066 --> 00:35:07.416
#Kind of a paradox.

L6-cue_448
00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:13.226
#Well, let’s squeeze nature into some kind of a difficulty here:

L6-cue_449
00:35:13.226 --> 00:35:14.706
I’ll show you what we’re going to do, see .

L6-cue_450
00:35:14.706 --> 00:35:18.956
. . We’re going to keep the light on; we’re going to watch.

L6-cue_451
00:35:18.956 --> 00:35:23.636
And you’re going to count—we’re going to count how many electrons come through.

L6-cue_452
00:35:23.636 --> 00:35:29.036
We’re going to make two columns.

L6-cue_453
00:35:29.036 --> 00:35:31.986
I’ll watch the holes very carefully while you, please,

L6-cue_454
00:35:31.986 --> 00:35:35.276
count how many are arriving in the detector.

L6-cue_455
00:35:35.276 --> 00:35:36.766
#All right, you say, one arrived.

L6-cue_456
00:35:36.766 --> 00:35:40.446
I said, I saw that when it went through Hole Number 1.

L6-cue_457
00:35:40.446 --> 00:35:48.576
We put here two columns, which is column one for Number 1 Hole and [Column 2 for] Number 2 Hole.

L6-cue_458
00:35:48.576 --> 00:35:52.096
Every time you get one, you tell me you got one I have seen it,

L6-cue_459
00:35:52.096 --> 00:35:53.926
of course, and I say either Number 1 or 2.

L6-cue_460
00:35:53.926 --> 00:35:55.616
#The first one was 1, what’s the next one?

L6-cue_461
00:35:55.616 --> 00:35:56.396
Number 2. All right.

L6-cue_462
00:35:56.396 --> 00:35:59.606
Number 2, Number 2, Number 1, so on.

L6-cue_463
00:35:59.606 --> 00:36:04.056
#As we watch the electrons—as I watch the electrons, for every one that you count,

L6-cue_464
00:36:04.056 --> 00:36:10.686
I can separate them experimentally into two columns: them that have arrived via Hole 1

L6-cue_465
00:36:10.686 --> 00:36:16.746
and those (I know the English is right; I’m just trying to) that arrived via Hole 2.

L6-cue_466
00:36:16.746 --> 00:36:23.256
So the number—the total number that arrived—well, first, what does this column look

L6-cue_467
00:36:23.256 --> 00:36:26.796
like when you add it all together for different positions here, which is just the number

L6-cue_468
00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:28.356
that have supposed to have come through 1.

L6-cue_469
00:36:28.356 --> 00:36:31.296
#I watch behind 1 and what do I see?

L6-cue_470
00:36:31.296 --> 00:36:37.196
#I see this curve-that column is distributed this way, just like we thought when we closed Hole 2;

L6-cue_471
00:36:37.196 --> 00:36:39.746
it works the same way whether we’re looking or not: if we close Hole 2,

L6-cue_472
00:36:39.746 --> 00:36:45.026
we get the same distribution—those that arrive [are] as if we were watching.

L6-cue_473
00:36:45.026 --> 00:36:47.276
Likewise, in this column that is supposed

L6-cue_474
00:36:47.276 --> 00:36:51.476
to have arrived via Hole Number 2, is also the simple curve.

L6-cue_475
00:36:51.476 --> 00:36:55.006
#Now, look, the total number which arrives has

L6-cue_476
00:36:55.006 --> 00:36:58.896
to be the total number—I’m just counting little marks!

L6-cue_477
00:36:58.896 --> 00:37:02.346
It has to be the sum of this number plus that number.

L6-cue_478
00:37:02.346 --> 00:37:06.996
The total number which arrived absolutely has to be the sum of these two;

L6-cue_479
00:37:06.996 --> 00:37:08.636
it has to be distributed this way!

L6-cue_480
00:37:08.636 --> 00:37:11.776
I said it was distributed this way;

L6-cue_481
00:37:11.776 --> 00:37:18.886
it’s distributed this way—it really is, of course; it has to be.

L6-cue_482
00:37:18.886 --> 00:37:22.236
It is. It’s distributed this way.

L6-cue_483
00:37:22.236 --> 00:37:27.656
#If, then, we mark with a prime the results when a light is lit (prime means with a light lit),

L6-cue_484
00:37:27.656 --> 00:37:32.166
then we find N-1-prime is practically the same as N-1 without the light,

L6-cue_485
00:37:32.166 --> 00:37:35.276
and N-2-prime is almost the same as N-2.

L6-cue_486
00:37:35.276 --> 00:37:42.146
But the number that we see when the light is on is not—is equal, is equal—to the number

L6-cue_487
00:37:42.146 --> 00:37:45.566
that we see through 1 plus the number that we see through 2.

L6-cue_488
00:37:45.566 --> 00:37:48.856
#This is the result that we get when the light is on.

L6-cue_489
00:37:48.856 --> 00:37:55.496
In other words, we get a different answer whether I turned on the light or not.

L6-cue_490
00:37:55.496 --> 00:38:00.386
If I have the light turned on, this is the distribution which you measure over here.

L6-cue_491
00:38:00.386 --> 00:38:04.456
If I turn off the light, this is the distribution that you measure over here.

L6-cue_492
00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:08.196
Turn on the light, this is the answer; turn off the light, that’s the answer.

L6-cue_493
00:38:08.196 --> 00:38:10.606
#See, nature’s squeezed out.

L6-cue_494
00:38:10.606 --> 00:38:19.806
#Now, we could say then, that the light affects the result.

L6-cue_495
00:38:19.806 --> 00:38:23.616
If the light is on, you get a different answer than if the light is off.

L6-cue_496
00:38:23.616 --> 00:38:26.076
If you want to, you could say there are light effects, it does affect.

L6-cue_497
00:38:26.076 --> 00:38:29.766
In fact, we’ve found by this experiment we get a difference with the light on and off.

L6-cue_498
00:38:29.766 --> 00:38:31.776
#Light affects the behavior of electrons.

L6-cue_499
00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.816
#If you want to talk about the motion of the electrons through here,

L6-cue_500
00:38:34.816 --> 00:38:39.006
which is a little inaccurate, you can: you can say that the light affects the motion,

L6-cue_501
00:38:39.006 --> 00:38:44.286
so that those which might have arrived at the maximum are somehow been deviated or kicked

L6-cue_502
00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:52.106
by the light and arrived at the minimum instead, thus smoothing the curve to produce this thing.

L6-cue_503
00:38:52.106 --> 00:38:54.916
#You see, electrons are very delicate.

L6-cue_504
00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:57.916
#Although, when you’re looking at a baseball and you shine light on it,

L6-cue_505
00:38:57.916 --> 00:39:00.086
it doesn’t make any difference, the baseball goes the same way.

L6-cue_506
00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:04.376
#Electrons are very flimsy, very delicate, and when you shine a light on,

L6-cue_507
00:39:04.376 --> 00:39:08.876
a little tough on the electron, it knocks them about a bit, and instead of doing that,

L6-cue_508
00:39:08.876 --> 00:39:12.826
they do this, because you turned the light on so strong—you hit ’em with a hammer;

L6-cue_509
00:39:12.826 --> 00:39:16.946
it’s not just a delicate thing like when you’re looking at a baseball with light.

L6-cue_510
00:39:16.946 --> 00:39:19.456
#There, you hit ’em with a hammer.

L6-cue_511
00:39:19.456 --> 00:39:23.616
#But you used-you turned up the light too strong: turn it weaker and weaker and weaker

L6-cue_512
00:39:23.616 --> 00:39:26.346
until it’s very dim, and then use very careful detectors

L6-cue_513
00:39:26.346 --> 00:39:30.406
that can see very dim light, and look with the dim light.

L6-cue_514
00:39:30.406 --> 00:39:33.556
Now, as the light gets dimmer and dimmer, you can’t expect with very, very,

L6-cue_515
00:39:33.556 --> 00:39:39.846
very weak light to affect the electron so completely as to change the pattern 100 percent

L6-cue_516
00:39:39.846 --> 00:39:43.096
from this pattern to this pattern; as the light gets weaker and weaker and weaker,

L6-cue_517
00:39:43.096 --> 00:39:46.926
somehow it should get more and more like no light at all.

L6-cue_518
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:48.656
#How, then, does this turn into that?

L6-cue_519
00:39:48.656 --> 00:39:55.576
#Well, it turns out that light is not like a wave of water, but light also comes

L6-cue_520
00:39:55.576 --> 00:40:01.796
in particle-like character called photon: as you turn down the intensity of the light,

L6-cue_521
00:40:01.796 --> 00:40:06.886
you’re not turning down the effect; you’re turning down the of photon particle—like things

L6-cue_522
00:40:06.886 --> 00:40:08.766
that are coming out of the source.

L6-cue_523
00:40:08.766 --> 00:40:12.816
So as I turn down the light, I’m getting fewer and fewer photons.

L6-cue_524
00:40:12.816 --> 00:40:18.826
The least I can scatter from an electron is one photon, and if I have too few photons, well,

L6-cue_525
00:40:18.826 --> 00:40:20.096
sometimes the electron will get through,

L6-cue_526
00:40:20.096 --> 00:40:23.646
and it just happened there wasn’t enough light—there was no photon coming by;

L6-cue_527
00:40:23.646 --> 00:40:25.026
I didn’t see it.

L6-cue_528
00:40:25.026 --> 00:40:29.236
A very weak light doesn’t mean a small disturbance; it just means a few photons.

L6-cue_529
00:40:29.236 --> 00:40:33.026
#What happens is that I have to invent a third column.

L6-cue_530
00:40:33.026 --> 00:40:34.886
#You see, you get a click over here.

L6-cue_531
00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:40.436
I say, "I saw that one, that was in Number 1 Hole; this was behind Hole Number 2."

L6-cue_532
00:40:40.436 --> 00:40:45.596
Then another comes: "Sorry, I didn’t see that"—there wasn’t enough light to give a photon

L6-cue_533
00:40:45.596 --> 00:40:49.146
at that time, so there must be a third column under "didn’t see."

L6-cue_534
00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:53.756
When the light is very strong there are very few in there.

L6-cue_535
00:40:53.756 --> 00:40:56.506
When the light is very weak, most of them end in there.

L6-cue_536
00:40:56.506 --> 00:41:00.776
That there are three columns, this one, this one, and, sometimes, in here.

L6-cue_537
00:41:00.776 --> 00:41:02.726
#You can guess what happens.

L6-cue_538
00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:08.026
#The ones I do see are distributed this way; the ones I didn’t see are distributed that way,

L6-cue_539
00:41:08.026 --> 00:41:12.766
and as I turn the light weaker and weaker, well, I see less and less of them—with greater

L6-cue_540
00:41:12.766 --> 00:41:14.846
and greater fraction are not seen.

L6-cue_541
00:41:14.846 --> 00:41:19.856
The actual curve, in any case, is a mixture of this and this, and as the light gets weaker

L6-cue_542
00:41:19.856 --> 00:41:28.926
so that fewer and fewer are seen, [it] gets more and more like that, in a continuous fashion.

L6-cue_543
00:41:28.926 --> 00:41:31.926
In this case, if the electrons are not seen, and nothing bounced off the light

L6-cue_544
00:41:31.926 --> 00:41:35.466
under those circumstances, you get this complicated pattern for those electrons

L6-cue_545
00:41:35.466 --> 00:41:38.966
which were not seen—the ones in the column "didn’t see" are exactly distributed

L6-cue_546
00:41:38.966 --> 00:41:48.656
in this complicated way, and the other two columns are in these two ways here.

L6-cue_547
00:41:48.656 --> 00:41:52.916
#Now, you say, "I got another way to measure which hole it goes through."

L6-cue_548
00:41:52.916 --> 00:41:57.296
I’m sorry, I haven’t got enough time to discuss a large number of different inventions

L6-cue_549
00:41:57.296 --> 00:42:01.166
that you might have, to find out which hole the electron went through,

L6-cue_550
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:03.326
and what happens in each case.

L6-cue_551
00:42:03.326 --> 00:42:09.356
It always turns out, however, that it’s impossible to arrange the light in any way,

L6-cue_552
00:42:09.356 --> 00:42:14.616
so that you can tell through which hole the thing is going, without disturbing the pattern

L6-cue_553
00:42:14.616 --> 00:42:20.956
of arrival of the electrons from this form to this form, without destroying the interference.

L6-cue_554
00:42:20.956 --> 00:42:24.386
Not only light, but anything else—you use neutrinos—you use anything,

L6-cue_555
00:42:24.386 --> 00:42:28.106
there’s [a] principle that it’s impossible to do it.

L6-cue_556
00:42:28.106 --> 00:42:31.796
#You can, if you want, invent a way to tell which hole the electron’s going through.

L6-cue_557
00:42:31.796 --> 00:42:34.696
Then it turns out it’s going through one or the other.

L6-cue_558
00:42:34.696 --> 00:42:38.716
If you try to make that instrument so that at the same time it doesn’t disturb the motion

L6-cue_559
00:42:38.716 --> 00:42:43.186
of the electrons, then what happens is you get back—you can’t tell anymore

L6-cue_560
00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:47.536
which one it goes through, and you get this; if you can tell, you get this.

L6-cue_561
00:42:47.536 --> 00:42:50.966
Heisenberg noticed, when he discovered the laws of quantum mechanics,

L6-cue_562
00:42:50.966 --> 00:42:55.316
that the new laws of nature that he discovered could only be consistent

L6-cue_563
00:42:55.316 --> 00:42:58.836
if there was some basic limitation to our experimental abilities

L6-cue_564
00:42:58.836 --> 00:43:01.946
that had not been previously recognized.

L6-cue_565
00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.526
#In other words, you can’t experimentally be as delicate

L6-cue_566
00:43:04.526 --> 00:43:09.846
as you wish-and he proposed his uncertainty principle, which,

L6-cue_567
00:43:09.846 --> 00:43:14.116
stated in terms of our experiment, is the following (he stated it in another way,

L6-cue_568
00:43:14.116 --> 00:43:17.256
but they’re exactly equivalent; you can get from one to the other, but unfortunately,

L6-cue_569
00:43:17.256 --> 00:43:21.246
I haven’t time to explain that)—in our experiment,

L6-cue_570
00:43:21.246 --> 00:43:24.366
his uncertainty principle would be stated in this manner:

L6-cue_571
00:43:24.366 --> 00:43:29.106
"it is impossible to design any apparatus whatsoever to determine

L6-cue_572
00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:32.536
which hole the electron passes (if one succeeds in determining

L6-cue_573
00:43:32.536 --> 00:43:38.216
which hole the electron passes—through which hole the elec—which can determine

L6-cue_574
00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.306
through which hole the electron passes) that will not

L6-cue_575
00:43:40.306 --> 00:43:45.766
at the same time disturb the electron enough to destroy the interference pattern."

L6-cue_576
00:43:45.766 --> 00:43:50.716
#No one has found a way around this, and I’m sure you’re all itching with inventions as to methods

L6-cue_577
00:43:50.716 --> 00:43:53.306
of detecting which hole the electron went through,

L6-cue_578
00:43:53.306 --> 00:43:56.376
but if each one of them is analyzed carefully, you’ll find out there’s something the matter

L6-cue_579
00:43:56.376 --> 00:43:59.976
with it— that if, without disturbing the electron, you think you can do it,

L6-cue_580
00:43:59.976 --> 00:44:03.916
but it turns out there’s always something the matter—and you can account for the difference

L6-cue_581
00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:07.376
in the patterns due to the disturbance of the instruments used to determine

L6-cue_582
00:44:07.376 --> 00:44:09.036
through which hole the electron comes.

L6-cue_583
00:44:09.036 --> 00:44:15.786
#Now this, therefore, is a basic characteristic of nature

L6-cue_584
00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:18.546
and tells us something about everything.

L6-cue_585
00:44:18.546 --> 00:44:24.256
If a new particle is found tomorrow, the kaon (actually it’s already been found—something,

L6-cue_586
00:44:24.256 --> 00:44:29.046
give it a name)—let’s say a kaon, and I use kaons to interact with electrons to determine

L6-cue_587
00:44:29.046 --> 00:44:34.166
which hole the electron is going through, I already know ahead of time (I hope) enough

L6-cue_588
00:44:34.166 --> 00:44:40.626
about the behavior of the kaon to say that it cannot be of such a type that I could tell

L6-cue_589
00:44:40.626 --> 00:44:45.236
through which hole the electron would go, without at the same time producing a disturbance

L6-cue_590
00:44:45.236 --> 00:44:48.216
on the electron to change the pattern from here to here.

L6-cue_591
00:44:48.216 --> 00:44:52.836
#The uncertainty principle is used as a general principle to guess ahead at many

L6-cue_592
00:44:52.836 --> 00:44:56.446
of the characteristics of unknown objects, Think how?

L6-cue_593
00:44:56.446 --> 00:44:58.096
limited in their character.

L6-cue_594
00:44:58.096 --> 00:45:00.486
Well, then, let’s go back.

L6-cue_595
00:45:00.486 --> 00:45:01.866
#What about this Proposition A?

L6-cue_596
00:45:01.866 --> 00:45:06.606
Does it go either through one hole or the other, or not?

L6-cue_597
00:45:06.606 --> 00:45:12.606
Well, physicists have a convention, a way of avoiding the pitfalls which exist,

L6-cue_598
00:45:12.606 --> 00:45:16.486
and they make their game, their rules of thinking, as follows.

L6-cue_599
00:45:16.486 --> 00:45:21.886
That if you have an apparatus which is capable of telling which hole the electron goes

L6-cue_600
00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.826
through (and you can have such apparati),

L6-cue_601
00:45:24.826 --> 00:45:28.926
then one can say that it either goes through one hole or the other.

L6-cue_602
00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:34.736
#It does, when you look; it always is going through one hole or the other—when you look.

L6-cue_603
00:45:34.736 --> 00:45:39.126
But when you do not try to determine, or you have no disturbance—no apparatus there

L6-cue_604
00:45:39.126 --> 00:45:43.206
to determine through which hole a thing goes— under those circumstances,

L6-cue_605
00:45:43.206 --> 00:45:47.486
you cannot say that it either goes through one hole or the other.

L6-cue_606
00:45:47.486 --> 00:45:50.636
You could always say it, provided you stop thinking immediately

L6-cue_607
00:45:50.636 --> 00:45:53.086
and don’t make any deduction from it; we prefer not to say it,

L6-cue_608
00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:56.726
rather than to stop thinking at the moment.

L6-cue_609
00:45:56.726 --> 00:45:59.846
#In other words, when we don’t look, we can’t say through which hole it’s going,

L6-cue_610
00:45:59.846 --> 00:46:03.386
but if you try to look to see, you find that it always goes through one hole or the other.

L6-cue_611
00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:07.206
#Still, to conclude that it goes either through one hole or the other when you’re not looking is

L6-cue_612
00:46:07.206 --> 00:46:11.066
to produce an error in prediction.

L6-cue_613
00:46:11.066 --> 00:46:20.636
That is the logical tightrope on which we have to walk if we wish to interpret nature.

L6-cue_614
00:46:20.636 --> 00:46:24.236
This proposition that I’m talking about is more general.

L6-cue_615
00:46:24.236 --> 00:46:29.956
It’s not just for two holes; it’s a general proposition—[it] reads something like this:

L6-cue_616
00:46:29.956 --> 00:46:34.456
that the probability of any event in an ideal experiment (that just means

L6-cue_617
00:46:34.456 --> 00:46:38.826
when everything is specified as well as it can be), the probability of an event is the square

L6-cue_618
00:46:38.826 --> 00:46:44.766
of something, which I call "A" here, is called the probability amplitude—and

L6-cue_619
00:46:44.766 --> 00:46:49.826
when an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude—this

L6-cue_620
00:46:49.826 --> 00:46:56.426
"A" number—is the sum of the A’s for each of the various alternatives; and finally,

L6-cue_621
00:46:56.426 --> 00:47:01.766
if an experiment is performed which is capable of determining which alternative is taken,

L6-cue_622
00:47:01.766 --> 00:47:05.356
the probability of the event is the sum of the probabilities

L6-cue_623
00:47:05.356 --> 00:47:07.926
for each alternative—that is, you lose the interference.

L6-cue_624
00:47:07.926 --> 00:47:11.066
Now, the question is, how does it really work?

L6-cue_625
00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:15.556
#By what machinery is actually producing this thing?

L6-cue_626
00:47:15.556 --> 00:47:18.596
#Well, nobody knows any machinery.

L6-cue_627
00:47:18.596 --> 00:47:22.446
Nobody can give you a deeper explanation of this phenomenon

L6-cue_628
00:47:22.446 --> 00:47:24.796
that I have given-that is, a description of it.

L6-cue_629
00:47:24.796 --> 00:47:30.696
#They can give you a wider explanation, in the sense that they could do more examples

L6-cue_630
00:47:30.696 --> 00:47:33.106
to show how it’s impossible to tell which hole it goes through,

L6-cue_631
00:47:33.106 --> 00:47:36.526
and at the same time not destroy the interference pattern.

L6-cue_632
00:47:36.526 --> 00:47:41.246
They can give a wider class of experiments than just the two—slit interference experiment,

L6-cue_633
00:47:41.246 --> 00:47:45.776
and so on, but they’re all—it’s just repeating the same thing to drive it in.

L6-cue_634
00:47:45.776 --> 00:47:49.246
#It’s not any deeper, it’s only wider: the mathematics can be made more precise;

L6-cue_635
00:47:49.246 --> 00:47:52.076
you can mention that they’re complex numbers instead of real numbers,

L6-cue_636
00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:56.256
and a couple of other minor points, which have nothing to do with the main idea.

L6-cue_637
00:47:56.256 --> 00:48:05.276
#The deep mystery is what I describe, and no one can go any deeper today—but only wider.

L6-cue_638
00:48:05.276 --> 00:48:13.076
#Now, I mentioned probabilities in this calculation.

L6-cue_639
00:48:13.076 --> 00:48:20.756
What we’re calculating here, this curve, is the probability of arrival of an electron.

L6-cue_640
00:48:20.756 --> 00:48:26.296
The question is, is there any way to determine where it really arrives?

L6-cue_641
00:48:26.296 --> 00:48:29.656
We are not averse to using the theory of probability—that is,

L6-cue_642
00:48:29.656 --> 00:48:32.946
calculating odds when a situation’s very complicated: you throw up a die,

L6-cue_643
00:48:32.946 --> 00:48:37.776
and it spins so many times in the air with the various resistance, and atoms,

L6-cue_644
00:48:37.776 --> 00:48:41.276
and all this complicated business that we’re perfectly willing to allow

L6-cue_645
00:48:41.276 --> 00:48:45.586
that we don’t know enough details—and so we calculate the odds

L6-cue_646
00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:48.816
that the thing’ll come this way or that way.

L6-cue_647
00:48:48.816 --> 00:48:54.586
But here, what we’re proposing, is it not, is that there be probability all the way back

L6-cue_648
00:48:54.586 --> 00:49:01.106
at the fundamental laws, that in the fundamental laws of physics there are odds.

L6-cue_649
00:49:01.106 --> 00:49:05.946
For example, suppose that I have an experiment so set up that with the light out,

L6-cue_650
00:49:05.946 --> 00:49:10.486
I get this interference situation, and know that.

L6-cue_651
00:49:10.486 --> 00:49:15.026
Then I say that with the light on, I can’t predict through which hole it will go.

L6-cue_652
00:49:15.026 --> 00:49:19.726
I only know that each time I look it’ll be one hole or the other, but there is no way

L6-cue_653
00:49:19.726 --> 00:49:23.166
to predict ahead of time through which hole it goes.

L6-cue_654
00:49:23.166 --> 00:49:29.096
The future, in other words, is unpredictable: it is impossible to predict in any way,

L6-cue_655
00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:33.446
from any information ahead of time, through which hole the thing will go—or

L6-cue_656
00:49:33.446 --> 00:49:39.976
which hole it will be seen behind.

L6-cue_657
00:49:39.976 --> 00:49:43.286
That means that physics has kind of given up,

L6-cue_658
00:49:43.286 --> 00:49:47.036
if the original purpose was (and everybody thought it was) to know enough

L6-cue_659
00:49:47.036 --> 00:49:50.816
that in given a situation you could predict what’s going to happen next,

L6-cue_660
00:49:50.816 --> 00:49:53.176
that given the circumstances you can predict what happens.

L6-cue_661
00:49:53.176 --> 00:49:55.946
Here are the circumstances: source, strong light source; tell me,

L6-cue_662
00:49:55.946 --> 00:49:58.146
behind which hole will I see the electron?

L6-cue_663
00:49:58.146 --> 00:50:02.256
#You say, "Well, the reason you can’t tell through which hole you’re going

L6-cue_664
00:50:02.256 --> 00:50:07.196
to see the electron is, it’s determined by some very complicated things back here:

L6-cue_665
00:50:07.196 --> 00:50:11.226
if I knew enough about that electron—it has internal wheels, internal gears,

L6-cue_666
00:50:11.226 --> 00:50:15.786
and so forth-and that this is what determines through which hole it goes.

L6-cue_667
00:50:15.786 --> 00:50:22.006
It’s 50/50 probability because, like a die, it’s set sort of at random—and if I were

L6-cue_668
00:50:22.006 --> 00:50:24.646
to have studied it carefully enough, your physics is incomplete:

L6-cue_669
00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:27.296
if you get a complete enough physics, then you’ll be able

L6-cue_670
00:50:27.296 --> 00:50:29.636
to predict through which hole it goes."

L6-cue_671
00:50:29.636 --> 00:50:32.846
That’s the "hidden variable" theory, so called.

L6-cue_672
00:50:32.846 --> 00:50:34.226
#Well, that’s not possible.

L6-cue_673
00:50:34.226 --> 00:50:37.836
#It is not due to a lack of detailed knowledge that we cannot make a prediction,

L6-cue_674
00:50:37.836 --> 00:50:43.606
because I said that if I didn’t turn on the light, I should get this interference pattern.

L6-cue_675
00:50:43.606 --> 00:50:47.296
If I have a circumstance in which I get that interference pattern, then it is impossible

L6-cue_676
00:50:47.296 --> 00:50:51.436
to analyze it in terms of saying, it goes through here or here, because that curve is

L6-cue_677
00:50:51.436 --> 00:50:54.806
so simple, mathematically—a different thing than the contribution

L6-cue_678
00:50:54.806 --> 00:50:57.586
of this and this as probabilities.

L6-cue_679
00:50:57.586 --> 00:51:03.606
#So if it were possible for you to have determined through which hole it was going to go

L6-cue_680
00:51:03.606 --> 00:51:08.286
if I had the light on, the fact that I had the light on hasn’t got anything to do with it!

L6-cue_681
00:51:08.286 --> 00:51:11.806
Whatever gears there are back here that you observe, which permitted you

L6-cue_682
00:51:11.806 --> 00:51:14.456
to tell me whether it was going to go through 1 or 2,

L6-cue_683
00:51:14.456 --> 00:51:17.586
you could have observed if I had the light off.

L6-cue_684
00:51:17.586 --> 00:51:20.456
And therefore you could have told me with the light off

L6-cue_685
00:51:20.456 --> 00:51:24.956
which hole—each time an electron goes—which hole it’s going to go through.

L6-cue_686
00:51:24.956 --> 00:51:28.766
But if you can do this, then that curve would have to be represented as the sum of those

L6-cue_687
00:51:28.766 --> 00:51:33.036
that go through there and those that go through there—and it ain’t.

L6-cue_688
00:51:33.036 --> 00:51:38.716
#Therefore, it’s impossible to have information ahead of time as to which hole it’s going to go

L6-cue_689
00:51:38.716 --> 00:51:43.646
through when the light is out—or when the light is on, or out—in a circumstance

L6-cue_690
00:51:43.646 --> 00:51:47.366
where the experiment is set up that can produce this interference pattern.

L6-cue_691
00:51:47.366 --> 00:51:51.776
#It is not a lack of unknown gears—a lack

L6-cue_692
00:51:51.776 --> 00:51:55.606
of internal complications—that makes nature have probability in it;

L6-cue_693
00:51:55.606 --> 00:51:58.046
it seems to be in some sense intrinsic.

L6-cue_694
00:51:58.046 --> 00:52:01.726
Someone has said it this way: "nature herself doesn’t know

L6-cue_695
00:52:01.726 --> 00:52:07.136
which way the electron is going to go."

L6-cue_696
00:52:07.136 --> 00:52:14.076
#A philosopher once said (a pompous one): "it is necessary for the very existence of science

L6-cue_697
00:52:14.076 --> 00:52:19.276
that the same conditions always produce the same result."

L6-cue_698
00:52:19.276 --> 00:52:26.856
#Well, they don’t: if you set up electrons in any way—I mean, you set up the circumstance here,

L6-cue_699
00:52:26.856 --> 00:52:30.196
in the same conditions every time, and you cannot predict behind

L6-cue_700
00:52:30.196 --> 00:52:36.756
which hole you’ll see the electron.

L6-cue_701
00:52:36.756 --> 00:52:39.516
They don’t-and yet the science goes on in spite of him.

L6-cue_702
00:52:39.516 --> 00:52:42.756
Although, the same conditions don’t produce the same results, that makes us unhappy,

L6-cue_703
00:52:42.756 --> 00:52:44.786
that we can’t predict exactly what’ll happen.

L6-cue_704
00:52:44.786 --> 00:52:48.456
#Incidentally, you can make a circumstance which is very dangerous and serious

L6-cue_705
00:52:48.456 --> 00:52:50.836
and man must know and you still can’t predict.

L6-cue_706
00:52:50.836 --> 00:52:53.496
For instance, we could cook up (I don’t know if we’d want to do that or not),

L6-cue_707
00:52:53.496 --> 00:52:56.126
but we could cook up a scheme by which we arrange photo cells so that

L6-cue_708
00:52:56.126 --> 00:53:01.006
if you see the electron—one electron’s going to go through—if we see it behind Hole Number 1,

L6-cue_709
00:53:01.006 --> 00:53:04.846
we set off the atomic bomb, and start World War III.

L6-cue_710
00:53:04.846 --> 00:53:11.056
If we see it behind Hole 2, we have—just make peace feelers,

L6-cue_711
00:53:11.056 --> 00:53:12.996
and delay the war a little longer.

L6-cue_712
00:53:12.996 --> 00:53:18.356
#Then the thing is, that the future of man would then be dependent upon something

L6-cue_713
00:53:18.356 --> 00:53:21.446
which no amount of science can predict.

L6-cue_714
00:53:21.446 --> 00:53:23.886
The world is-the future is unpredictable.

L6-cue_715
00:53:23.886 --> 00:53:30.236
What is necessary for the very existence of science, and what the characteristics

L6-cue_716
00:53:30.236 --> 00:53:34.526
of nature are, are not to be determined by pompous preconditions.

L6-cue_717
00:53:34.526 --> 00:53:37.956
They’re to be determined—they are determined always by the material with which we work,

L6-cue_718
00:53:37.956 --> 00:53:41.896
by nature herself: we look and we see what we’re going to find—what we find.

L6-cue_719
00:53:41.896 --> 00:53:45.946
We cannot say ahead of time, successfully, what it’s going to look like.

L6-cue_720
00:53:45.946 --> 00:53:51.366
The most reasonable possibilities turn out often not to be the situation.

L6-cue_721
00:53:51.366 --> 00:53:57.546
What is necessary for the very existence of science is just the ability to experiment,

L6-cue_722
00:53:57.546 --> 00:54:00.906
the honesty in reporting results—the results must be reported

L6-cue_723
00:54:00.906 --> 00:54:06.056
without somebody saying what they’d like the results to have had been—and finally,

L6-cue_724
00:54:06.056 --> 00:54:10.526
an important thing, is the intelligence to interpret the results, but important point

L6-cue_725
00:54:10.526 --> 00:54:14.706
about this intelligence is: that it must not—it should not—be sure ahead

L6-cue_726
00:54:14.706 --> 00:54:17.496
of time about what must be.

L6-cue_727
00:54:17.496 --> 00:54:22.786
#Now, it can be prejudiced, and say, "That’s very unlikely—I don’t like that."

L6-cue_728
00:54:22.786 --> 00:54:25.046
Prejudice is different than absolute certainty.

L6-cue_729
00:54:25.046 --> 00:54:31.356
I don’t mean absolute prejudice, just bias—but not strict bias, not complete prejudice.

L6-cue_730
00:54:31.356 --> 00:54:35.356
As long as you’re biased, it doesn’t make any difference, because if the fact is true,

L6-cue_731
00:54:35.356 --> 00:54:40.006
there will be a perpetual accumulation of experiments to perpetually annoy you,

L6-cue_732
00:54:40.006 --> 00:54:42.746
until they cannot be disregarded any longer.

L6-cue_733
00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:45.486
#[They] only can be disregarded if you’re absolutely sure ahead of time

L6-cue_734
00:54:45.486 --> 00:54:49.486
of some precondition that science has to have.

L6-cue_735
00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:55.936
In fact, it is necessary for the very existence of science that minds exist, which do not allow

L6-cue_736
00:54:55.936 --> 00:55:02.246
that nature must satisfy some preconceived conditions like those of our philosophers.

L6-cue_737
00:55:02.246 --> 00:56:32.000
#Thank you.
