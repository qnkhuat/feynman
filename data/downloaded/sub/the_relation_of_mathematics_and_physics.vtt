##Title The Relation of Mathematics and Physics

L2-cue_3
00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:34.306
#Hi. I can see the audience tonight, so I can see also from the size

L2-cue_4
00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:39.906
of it (which last time was a black splot in front of my eyes), that there must be many

L2-cue_5
00:01:39.906 --> 00:01:43.376
of you here who are not thoroughly familiar with physics,

L2-cue_6
00:01:43.376 --> 00:01:49.796
and also a number that are not too versed in mathematics—and I don’t doubt

L2-cue_7
00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:54.186
that there are some who know neither physics nor mathematics very well.

L2-cue_8
00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:58.796
That puts a considerable challenge on a speaker who is going to speak on the relation of physics

L2-cue_9
00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:08.246
and mathematics—a challenge which I, however, will not accept: I published the title

L2-cue_10
00:02:08.246 --> 00:02:11.956
of the talk in clear and precise language, and didn’t make it sound

L2-cue_11
00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:15.056
like it was something it wasn’t—it’s the relation of physics and mathematics—and

L2-cue_12
00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:19.626
if you find that in some spots it assumes some minor knowledge of physics

L2-cue_13
00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:22.796
or mathematics, I cannot help it.

L2-cue_14
00:02:22.796 --> 00:02:25.826
It was named so.

L2-cue_15
00:02:25.826 --> 00:02:32.996
#In thinking of the applications of mathematics to physics, it’s perfectly natural

L2-cue_16
00:02:32.996 --> 00:02:40.076
that mathematics will be useful when large numbers are involved in complex situations.

L2-cue_17
00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:45.586
Although, for example, if we took biology, the action of a virus on a bacterium is,

L2-cue_18
00:02:45.586 --> 00:02:49.896
if you watch it under the microscope, unmathematical: a jiggling virus finds some spot

L2-cue_19
00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:54.046
on this odd—shape bacterium—they’re all different shapes—and finds some spot;

L2-cue_20
00:02:54.046 --> 00:03:00.006
maybe it pushes its DNA in, and maybe it doesn’t, and so forth.

L2-cue_21
00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:05.706
And yet, if we do the experiment with millions and billions of bacteria and viruses,

L2-cue_22
00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:09.196
then we can learn a great deal about the virus—it’s like taking averages and working

L2-cue_23
00:03:09.196 --> 00:03:14.156
with large numbers: we can use the mathematics involved in the averaging;

L2-cue_24
00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:19.126
we can see whether the viruses develop in the bacteria some new strains, and what percentage,

L2-cue_25
00:03:19.126 --> 00:03:24.376
so we can study the genetics, the mutation, and so forth.

L2-cue_26
00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:27.626
#To take another—more trivial—example,

L2-cue_27
00:03:27.626 --> 00:03:38.416
imagine an enormous board—a checkerboard—to play checkers (or draughts):

L2-cue_28
00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:42.026
if the board is very large, the actual operation

L2-cue_29
00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:47.926
of any one step is not mathematical—or very simple, if it is mathematical:

L2-cue_30
00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:51.496
it either goes one side or the other on the diagonal, or it reaches [the end]

L2-cue_31
00:03:51.496 --> 00:03:54.466
and becomes a king, and can go backwards when it reaches the end.

L2-cue_32
00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.186
In other words, the statement of the rules are very simple,

L2-cue_33
00:03:56.186 --> 00:03:59.246
and do not really involve any mathematics.

L2-cue_34
00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:02.736
But you could imagine that on an enormous board with lots and lots of pieces,

L2-cue_35
00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:07.866
some analysis of the best move—or good moves or bad moves—might be made by a deep kind

L2-cue_36
00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:11.596
of reasoning, which would involve somebody having gone off first and thought about it

L2-cue_37
00:04:11.596 --> 00:04:15.576
in great depth-and that becomes mathematics, this abstract reasoning.

L2-cue_38
00:04:15.576 --> 00:04:18.066
#Another example is switching, in computers.

L2-cue_39
00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:22.086
If you have one switch, it’s either on or off, and there’s nothing very mathematical

L2-cue_40
00:04:22.086 --> 00:04:26.036
about that (although mathematicians like to start there with their mathematics).

L2-cue_41
00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.446
But with all the interconnections and wires to figure

L2-cue_42
00:04:29.446 --> 00:04:33.636
out what a very large system will do, one requires a mathematics.

L2-cue_43
00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.886
#I would like immediately to say

L2-cue_44
00:04:35.886 --> 00:04:40.546
that a mathematics has its primary application—it has a tremendous application—in

L2-cue_45
00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:45.336
physics in the discussion of the detailed phenomena in complicated situations,

L2-cue_46
00:04:45.336 --> 00:04:48.846
granting the fundamental rules of the game.

L2-cue_47
00:04:48.846 --> 00:04:52.766
And that is something which, if I were talking only about the relation of mathematics

L2-cue_48
00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:56.106
and physics, I would spend most of my time discussing.

L2-cue_49
00:04:56.106 --> 00:05:00.126
But since this is part of a series of lectures on the character of physical law,

L2-cue_50
00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:04.856
I do not have the time to discuss the applications of mathematics and physics

L2-cue_51
00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.766
to calculating what happens in complicated situations.

L2-cue_52
00:05:07.766 --> 00:05:12.306
But we’ll go immediately to another question, which is the character of the fundamental law.

L2-cue_53
00:05:12.306 --> 00:05:14.676
#If we go back to our checker game,

L2-cue_54
00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:18.546
the fundamental laws are the rules by which the checkers move.

L2-cue_55
00:05:18.546 --> 00:05:22.226
The mathematics may be applied in a complex situation—to figure out what happens

L2-cue_56
00:05:22.226 --> 00:05:24.596
in the next move, what’s a good move to make

L2-cue_57
00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:29.506
in a complicated situation—but very little mathematics is needed in the fundamental,

L2-cue_58
00:05:29.506 --> 00:05:34.996
simple character of the basic laws.

L2-cue_59
00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:37.446
#Now, the strange thing about physics is,

L2-cue_60
00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:42.236
that for the fundamental laws, we still need mathematics.

L2-cue_61
00:05:42.236 --> 00:05:48.226
For example-well, I give two examples: one in which we really do not, and one in which we do.

L2-cue_62
00:05:48.226 --> 00:05:53.216
#There’s a law in physics called Faraday’s Law, which says that in electrolysis the amount

L2-cue_63
00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:56.836
of material which is deposited is proportional to the current,

L2-cue_64
00:05:56.836 --> 00:06:00.736
and to the time that the current is acting—and that means that the amount

L2-cue_65
00:06:00.736 --> 00:06:04.216
of material is proportional to the charge which goes through the system.

L2-cue_66
00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:05.606
Well, it sounds very mathematical.

L2-cue_67
00:06:05.606 --> 00:06:11.706
But what’s actually happening is that electrons going through the wire each carry one charge.

L2-cue_68
00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.336
To take an example, a particular example,

L2-cue_69
00:06:14.336 --> 00:06:19.666
it may be that to deposit one atom requires one electron to come, and so the number of atoms

L2-cue_70
00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:23.746
that are deposited are necessarily proportional to the number of electrons that flow,

L2-cue_71
00:06:23.746 --> 00:06:25.236
and thus to the charge that goes through the wire.

L2-cue_72
00:06:25.236 --> 00:06:30.386
So the mathematically-appearing law has as its basis nothing very deep,

L2-cue_73
00:06:30.386 --> 00:06:35.036
requiring no real knowledge of mathematics, that one electron is needed for each atom

L2-cue_74
00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:36.496
in order for it to deposit itself.

L2-cue_75
00:06:36.496 --> 00:06:40.866
That’s not a deep-that’s mathematics, if I had to say, number one, but it’s not the kind

L2-cue_76
00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:43.676
of mathematics I’m talking about tonight.

L2-cue_77
00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:49.026
#Now, if we take, on the other hand, Newton’s law for gravitation (which has these aspects

L2-cue_78
00:06:49.026 --> 00:06:52.406
which I wrote down last time just to impress you with the speed

L2-cue_79
00:06:52.406 --> 00:06:56.296
at which mathematical symbols can convey—can carry—information),

L2-cue_80
00:06:56.296 --> 00:07:00.266
we said that the force was proportional to the product of the masses of two objects,

L2-cue_81
00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:04.866
and inversely as the square of the distance between them, and that bodies react to forces

L2-cue_82
00:07:04.866 --> 00:07:09.706
by changing their speeds—or changing their motions—in a direction of the force

L2-cue_83
00:07:09.706 --> 00:07:14.666
by amounts proportional to the force, and inversely proportional to their masses.

L2-cue_84
00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:20.356
Now that’s words all right, and I didn’t have to write the equation, but nevertheless it’s kind

L2-cue_85
00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:25.316
of mathematical, and we would wonder: how can this be a fundamental law?

L2-cue_86
00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:28.086
How can this planet out there look—what does it do?

L2-cue_87
00:07:28.086 --> 00:07:32.146
It looks at the sun, and it sees how far away it is, and it decides to calculate

L2-cue_88
00:07:32.146 --> 00:07:34.706
on its internal adding machine the inverse of the square

L2-cue_89
00:07:34.706 --> 00:07:37.006
of the distance-and that tells it how much to move?

L2-cue_90
00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:41.586
This is certainly no explanation of the machinery of gravitation!

L2-cue_91
00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:46.276
So you might want to look further, and various people have tried to look further:

L2-cue_92
00:07:46.276 --> 00:07:51.746
Newton was originally asked, "It doesn’t mean anything; it doesn’t tell us anything!"

L2-cue_93
00:07:51.746 --> 00:07:53.436
He says, "It tells you how it moves.

L2-cue_94
00:07:53.436 --> 00:08:00.266
It should be enough—I told you how it moves, not why."

L2-cue_95
00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:03.806
#But people are often unsatisfied without a mechanism,

L2-cue_96
00:08:03.806 --> 00:08:10.886
and I would like to describe one theory which has been invented (among others) of the type

L2-cue_97
00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:15.496
that you might want, that this is a result of large numbers—and that’s why it’s mathematical.

L2-cue_98
00:08:15.496 --> 00:08:18.156
And I give this theory—perhaps you’ve thought of it yourself;

L2-cue_99
00:08:18.156 --> 00:08:22.846
every once in a while some student comes running in; he suddenly explains gravitation.

L2-cue_100
00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:25.606
#Suppose that in the world, everywhere, there are,

L2-cue_101
00:08:25.606 --> 00:08:28.446
flying through us at very high speed, a lot of particles.

L2-cue_102
00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:31.326
They come equally in all directions; they’re just shooting by, shooting by,

L2-cue_103
00:08:31.326 --> 00:08:35.896
shooting by-and once in a while hit us in a bombardment.

L2-cue_104
00:08:35.896 --> 00:08:41.106
We and the sun are practically transparent for them—nearly—but some hit,

L2-cue_105
00:08:41.106 --> 00:08:43.556
and so it’s not completely transparent.

L2-cue_106
00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:48.606
And look what would happen: if the sun is here and the earth is here,

L2-cue_107
00:08:48.606 --> 00:08:52.476
then if the sun weren’t here, there would be particles bombarding from all sides,

L2-cue_108
00:08:52.476 --> 00:08:55.126
giving little impulses by the rattle of these—bang, bang,

L2-cue_109
00:08:55.126 --> 00:08:58.986
the few that hit—which would not shake the earth in any particular direction,

L2-cue_110
00:08:58.986 --> 00:09:02.726
because there’s as many coming from one side as the other, from top, from bottom.

L2-cue_111
00:09:02.726 --> 00:09:07.396
#However, when the sun is here, the particles which are coming

L2-cue_112
00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.936
in this direction are partly absorbed by the sun,

L2-cue_113
00:09:10.936 --> 00:09:14.046
because some of them hit the sun and don’t go through.

L2-cue_114
00:09:14.046 --> 00:09:18.236
Therefore, the number that are coming from this direction toward the earth is less

L2-cue_115
00:09:18.236 --> 00:09:20.036
than the number that are coming from the other side,

L2-cue_116
00:09:20.036 --> 00:09:23.476
because here they have no opposition from the sun there.

L2-cue_117
00:09:23.476 --> 00:09:30.496
#And it’s easy to see (after some mental effort) that the further the sun is away,

L2-cue_118
00:09:30.496 --> 00:09:34.996
the less (in proportion of all of the particles) are being taken out of the possible directions

L2-cue_119
00:09:34.996 --> 00:09:36.626
in which particles can come—I mean,

L2-cue_120
00:09:36.626 --> 00:09:41.786
the solar size appears smaller—in fact inversely as the square of the distance.

L2-cue_121
00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:46.326
So there will, therefore, be an impulse toward the sun on the earth that’s inversely

L2-cue_122
00:09:46.326 --> 00:09:51.516
as the square of the distance, and is a result of large numbers of very simple operations;

L2-cue_123
00:09:51.516 --> 00:09:55.176
just hit one after the other from all directions.

L2-cue_124
00:09:55.176 --> 00:09:57.186
#And, therefore, the strangeness

L2-cue_125
00:09:57.186 --> 00:09:59.576
of the mathematical relation would be very much reduced,

L2-cue_126
00:09:59.576 --> 00:10:03.246
because the fundamental operation is much simpler than calculating the inverse

L2-cue_127
00:10:03.246 --> 00:10:08.056
of the square of the distance: this "machine" does the calculating—these particles bouncing.

L2-cue_128
00:10:08.056 --> 00:10:15.126
#The only trouble with it is that it doesn’t work—for other reasons:

L2-cue_129
00:10:15.126 --> 00:10:19.706
every theory that you make up has to be analyzed against all the possible consequences,

L2-cue_130
00:10:19.706 --> 00:10:24.006
to see if it predicts anything else—and this predicts something else.

L2-cue_131
00:10:24.006 --> 00:10:29.486
If the earth is moving this way, more particles would hit it from the front than from the back.

L2-cue_132
00:10:29.486 --> 00:10:33.096
If you’re running in the rain, more rain hits you in the front of the face than in the back

L2-cue_133
00:10:33.096 --> 00:10:35.706
of the head, because you’re running into the rain.

L2-cue_134
00:10:35.706 --> 00:10:38.746
And so, as the earth is moving in this direction, it’s running into the particles,

L2-cue_135
00:10:38.746 --> 00:10:41.826
rather, and running away from the ones that are chasing it from behind,

L2-cue_136
00:10:41.826 --> 00:10:44.416
so that more particles hit it from the front than from the back.

L2-cue_137
00:10:44.416 --> 00:10:48.506
And there would be a force also sideways whenever there was any motion [that way].

L2-cue_138
00:10:48.506 --> 00:10:50.976
This sideways force would slow the earth up in the orbit

L2-cue_139
00:10:50.976 --> 00:10:55.126
and certainly would not have lasted the three or four billion years

L2-cue_140
00:10:55.126 --> 00:10:56.836
that it has been going around the sun.

L2-cue_141
00:10:56.836 --> 00:11:00.206
So that’s the end of that theory.

L2-cue_142
00:11:00.206 --> 00:11:02.966
#Well, you say, that was a good one, though: it got rid of the mathematics

L2-cue_143
00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:08.106
for a while; maybe I can invent a better one.

L2-cue_144
00:11:08.106 --> 00:11:12.376
And maybe you can, because nobody knows the ultimate.

L2-cue_145
00:11:12.376 --> 00:11:17.836
But up to today, from the time of Newton, no one has invented another theoretical description

L2-cue_146
00:11:17.836 --> 00:11:23.386
of the mathematical machinery behind this law which does anything else but say the same thing

L2-cue_147
00:11:23.386 --> 00:11:26.616
over again, or make the mathematics harder,

L2-cue_148
00:11:26.616 --> 00:11:30.066
and at the same time doesn’t produce some wrong phenomenon—I mean

L2-cue_149
00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:33.706
like this model does it—but it produces something which isn’t true.

L2-cue_150
00:11:33.706 --> 00:11:35.726
#So there is no model of the theory

L2-cue_151
00:11:35.726 --> 00:11:40.256
of gravitation today other than the mathematical form.

L2-cue_152
00:11:40.256 --> 00:11:45.726
If this were the only law of this character, it would be interesting and rather annoying.

L2-cue_153
00:11:45.726 --> 00:11:49.616
But what turns out to be true is that the more we investigate, and the more laws we find,

L2-cue_154
00:11:49.616 --> 00:11:53.216
and the deeper we penetrate nature, this disease—that every one

L2-cue_155
00:11:53.216 --> 00:11:57.186
of our laws is a purely mathematical statement in rather complex

L2-cue_156
00:11:57.186 --> 00:12:02.326
and abstruse mathematics (this is relatively simple mathematics)—gets more and more abstruse,

L2-cue_157
00:12:02.326 --> 00:12:04.796
and more and more difficult, as mathematics.

L2-cue_158
00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:08.486
#Why? I haven’t the slightest idea why.

L2-cue_159
00:12:08.486 --> 00:12:12.536
It is only my purpose in this lecture to tell you about this fact.

L2-cue_160
00:12:12.536 --> 00:12:18.336
In other words, it’s my purpose in this lecture to explain, really, why I cannot satisfy you,

L2-cue_161
00:12:18.336 --> 00:12:23.286
if you do not understand mathematics too well, in trying to explain nature in any other way.

L2-cue_162
00:12:23.286 --> 00:12:29.136
It is the burden of this lecture, in fact, to just tell you the fact that it is impossible

L2-cue_163
00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:34.706
to answer—really, honestly—the challenge of explaining, in a way that a person can feel,

L2-cue_164
00:12:34.706 --> 00:12:39.326
the beauties of the laws of nature without their having some deep understanding of mathematics.

L2-cue_165
00:12:39.326 --> 00:12:43.796
I’m sorry, but it seems to be the case.

L2-cue_166
00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:46.716
#You might say, "All right, then, there’s no explanation of the law;

L2-cue_167
00:12:46.716 --> 00:12:51.916
at least tell me what the law is—why not tell me in words instead of in the symbols?

L2-cue_168
00:12:51.916 --> 00:12:55.956
Mathematics is just a language, and I want to be able to translate the language."

L2-cue_169
00:12:55.956 --> 00:12:59.636
And, in fact, I can—and with patience, I think I partly did.

L2-cue_170
00:12:59.636 --> 00:13:03.436
I could go a little further and explain more detail—that this means if it’s twice

L2-cue_171
00:13:03.436 --> 00:13:08.626
as far away the force is one—fourth as much, and so on—and can convert all these into words.

L2-cue_172
00:13:08.626 --> 00:13:11.596
I would be, in other words, kind to the layman, as they all sit,

L2-cue_173
00:13:11.596 --> 00:13:13.666
hopeful that you will explain something.

L2-cue_174
00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:19.166
Various different people get different reputations for their skill at explaining

L2-cue_175
00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:25.576
to the layman in layman’s language these difficult and abstruse subjects.

L2-cue_176
00:13:25.576 --> 00:13:33.956
#The layman then searches for book after book with the hope that he will avoid the complexity

L2-cue_177
00:13:33.956 --> 00:13:38.676
which ultimately sets in, even by the best expositor of this type.

L2-cue_178
00:13:38.676 --> 00:13:44.076
He reads the things, hoping—he finds, as he reads, a generally increased confusion,

L2-cue_179
00:13:44.076 --> 00:13:48.716
one complicated statement after the other, one difficult—to—understand thing after the other,

L2-cue_180
00:13:48.716 --> 00:13:52.766
all apparently disconnected from one another—and it becomes a little obscure,

L2-cue_181
00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:56.846
and he hopes that maybe in some other book there’s some explanation which avoids—I mean,

L2-cue_182
00:13:56.846 --> 00:14:02.206
the man almost made it, you see—maybe another fellow makes it right.

L2-cue_183
00:14:02.206 --> 00:14:05.176
#I don’t think it’s possible, because there’s another feature:

L2-cue_184
00:14:05.176 --> 00:14:10.726
mathematics is not just a language; mathematics is a language plus reasoning;

L2-cue_185
00:14:10.726 --> 00:14:13.766
it’s like a language plus logic.

L2-cue_186
00:14:13.766 --> 00:14:15.966
Mathematics is a tool for reasoning.

L2-cue_187
00:14:15.966 --> 00:14:23.366
It’s in fact a big collection of the results of some person’s careful thought and reasoning.

L2-cue_188
00:14:23.366 --> 00:14:28.526
By mathematics it is possible to connect one statement to another.

L2-cue_189
00:14:28.526 --> 00:14:32.016
For instance, I can say that the force is directed toward the sun.

L2-cue_190
00:14:32.016 --> 00:14:38.476
I can also tell you, as I did before, that the planet moves—so if I draw a line from the sun

L2-cue_191
00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:45.186
to the planet, and draw another one at some definite period like three weeks later,

L2-cue_192
00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:49.946
the area that is swung out by the planet is exactly the same

L2-cue_193
00:14:49.946 --> 00:14:52.286
as it will be the next three weeks, and the next three weeks,

L2-cue_194
00:14:52.286 --> 00:14:54.896
and so on, as it goes around the sun.

L2-cue_195
00:14:54.896 --> 00:14:58.536
#Now, I could explain both of those statements to you carefully,

L2-cue_196
00:14:58.536 --> 00:15:03.306
but I cannot explain why they’re both the same—so

L2-cue_197
00:15:03.306 --> 00:15:10.646
that if you don’t appreciate the mathematics, you cannot see that the great variety of facts,

L2-cue_198
00:15:10.646 --> 00:15:15.566
the enormous apparent complexity of nature—with all its funny laws and rules,

L2-cue_199
00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:20.406
each of which have been carefully explained to you—are really very closely interwoven,

L2-cue_200
00:15:20.406 --> 00:15:23.616
that logic permits you to go from one to the other.

L2-cue_201
00:15:23.616 --> 00:15:29.746
#It may be unbelievable that I can demonstrate that equal times will be swept

L2-cue_202
00:15:29.746 --> 00:15:33.616
out if the forces are directed toward the sun.

L2-cue_203
00:15:33.616 --> 00:15:36.846
If I may try, I will show you one demonstration,

L2-cue_204
00:15:36.846 --> 00:15:41.146
to show you that those two things really are equivalent, so that you can appreciate

L2-cue_205
00:15:41.146 --> 00:15:45.876
that there’s more to merely the statement of the two laws; that the two laws are connected

L2-cue_206
00:15:45.876 --> 00:15:49.266
such that reasoning alone will bring you from one to the other;

L2-cue_207
00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:52.846
that mathematics is this organized reasoning, and that it’s good to know how

L2-cue_208
00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:57.426
to do that-so you will appreciate the beauty of the relationship of the statement.

L2-cue_209
00:15:57.426 --> 00:15:59.396
So I’m going to prove, if I may,

L2-cue_210
00:15:59.396 --> 00:16:06.086
the relationship that if the forces are directed toward the sun,

L2-cue_211
00:16:06.086 --> 00:16:08.266
that the equal areas are swept out in equal time.

L2-cue_212
00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:09.006
#So, we start.

L2-cue_213
00:16:09.006 --> 00:16:16.886
Here’s the sun, and we imagine at a certain time, let’s say the planet is here,

L2-cue_214
00:16:16.886 --> 00:16:21.016
and is moving in such a way that let’s say one second later—or one hour, pick any time,

L2-cue_215
00:16:21.016 --> 00:16:26.116
say one second later—it’s moved in such a manner that it has gotten to the position 2.

L2-cue_216
00:16:26.116 --> 00:16:33.396
Now, if the sun did not exert any force on it, then by Galileo’s principle,

L2-cue_217
00:16:33.396 --> 00:16:35.816
it would keep right on going in a straight line.

L2-cue_218
00:16:35.816 --> 00:16:41.066
So in the same interval of time—later, the next second—it’ll move exactly the same distance

L2-cue_219
00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:46.136
in the same straight line to the position 3, were there no force.

L2-cue_220
00:16:46.136 --> 00:16:46.386
All right.

L2-cue_221
00:16:46.386 --> 00:16:51.536
Now first we’re going to show that if there’s no force, equal areas are swept out in equal time.

L2-cue_222
00:16:51.536 --> 00:16:55.816
#I remind you that the area of a triangle is half the base times the altitude,

L2-cue_223
00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:59.606
and that the altitude is the vertical distance to the base.

L2-cue_224
00:16:59.606 --> 00:17:05.676
And that if the triangle is sort of cockeyed (there’s a name for it which I forget—obtuse!

L2-cue_225
00:17:05.676 --> 00:17:10.026
obtuse!), then the altitude is this vertical height here.

L2-cue_226
00:17:10.026 --> 00:17:15.566
(I know about the triangles; I just don’t know their names.)

L2-cue_227
00:17:15.566 --> 00:17:21.796
Now, let us draw the lines to these two points in the case that there was no motion whatsoever.

L2-cue_228
00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:24.916
#The question is-it doesn’t draw very well; I’m not accurate,

L2-cue_229
00:17:24.916 --> 00:17:27.406
but these two distances are equal, remember.

L2-cue_230
00:17:27.406 --> 00:17:30.086
The question is: are these two areas equal?

L2-cue_231
00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:37.026
Well, consider the triangle made from the sun and the two points 1 and 2; it’s this one.

L2-cue_232
00:17:37.026 --> 00:17:39.146
What’s its area?

L2-cue_233
00:17:39.146 --> 00:17:43.686
It’s this base multiplied by this height.

L2-cue_234
00:17:43.686 --> 00:17:50.676
And what about the other triangle, which is the triangle in motion from 2 to 3?

L2-cue_235
00:17:50.676 --> 00:17:54.816
It’s this base times the same altitude: the two triangles have the same altitude,

L2-cue_236
00:17:54.816 --> 00:17:57.576
and as I indicated, the same base and have the same area.

L2-cue_237
00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:59.086
So, so far so good.

L2-cue_238
00:17:59.086 --> 00:18:03.156
If there were no force from the sun, equal areas would be swept out in equal times;

L2-cue_239
00:18:03.156 --> 00:18:04.846
the two triangles have equal areas.

L2-cue_240
00:18:04.846 --> 00:18:08.706
But there is a force from the sun, and during this interval from 1 to 2

L2-cue_241
00:18:08.706 --> 00:18:11.576
to 3 the sun is pulling and changing the motion

L2-cue_242
00:18:11.576 --> 00:18:14.826
in various directions—this way, this way, that way.

L2-cue_243
00:18:14.826 --> 00:18:18.986
#To get a good approximation to that, we’ll take the central position, or average position, here,

L2-cue_244
00:18:18.986 --> 00:18:24.086
and say that the whole effect during this interval was to change the motion by some amount

L2-cue_245
00:18:24.086 --> 00:18:27.506
in this direction, toward the sun.

L2-cue_246
00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:32.846
That means that although the particles were moving this way, and would have moved this way

L2-cue_247
00:18:32.846 --> 00:18:39.056
in the next second; because of the influence of the sun the motion is altered

L2-cue_248
00:18:39.056 --> 00:18:43.466
by an amount that’s poking in this direction, that’s parallel to this,

L2-cue_249
00:18:43.466 --> 00:18:46.726
exactly parallel—these lines are parallel.

L2-cue_250
00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:50.096
It’s the direction in which this new motion—there’s a new motion,

L2-cue_251
00:18:50.096 --> 00:18:56.316
a compound of what I wanted to do and the change that’s been induced by the action of the sun.

L2-cue_252
00:18:56.316 --> 00:19:00.546
So it doesn’t really end up at position 3, but rather at position 4.

L2-cue_253
00:19:00.546 --> 00:19:06.676
#So now we would like to compare (it’s getting complicated in the diagram) the triangle 2—4—S

L2-cue_254
00:19:06.676 --> 00:19:10.016
and 2-3-S-I show you that those are equal.

L2-cue_255
00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:13.906
Because they have the same base [2—S] those two triangles—this one here,

L2-cue_256
00:19:13.906 --> 00:19:16.516
and the one that happened when we had no force; the one with force,

L2-cue_257
00:19:16.516 --> 00:19:18.566
and with no force have the same base.

L2-cue_258
00:19:18.566 --> 00:19:19.726
And do they have the same altitude?

L2-cue_259
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.816
Sure—because they’re included between parallel lines [2—S and 3—4],

L2-cue_260
00:19:22.816 --> 00:19:25.186
and so they have the same altitude.

L2-cue_261
00:19:25.186 --> 00:19:29.126
And thus the area of the last triangle I drew [S—2—4] is the same

L2-cue_262
00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:31.246
as the second one I drew, this [S]—2—3.

L2-cue_263
00:19:31.246 --> 00:19:33.416
And that, I had proved earlier, was the same as the first one [S—1—2].

L2-cue_264
00:19:33.416 --> 00:19:38.296
So in the actual orbital motion of the planet, the areas—you have the first

L2-cue_265
00:19:38.296 --> 00:19:42.056
in the first second, and in the second second—are equal.

L2-cue_266
00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:45.506
#So by reasoning we can see a connection between the the fact

L2-cue_267
00:19:45.506 --> 00:19:52.606
that that the force is toward the sun, and that the areas are equal.

L2-cue_268
00:19:52.606 --> 00:19:53.376
Ingenious, no?

L2-cue_269
00:19:53.376 --> 00:19:56.666
I borrowed this from Newton: it comes right out of the Principia, diagram and all.

L2-cue_270
00:19:56.666 --> 00:20:01.716
The letters are different, that’s all—because he wrote in Latin.

L2-cue_271
00:20:01.716 --> 00:20:04.416
(These are Arabic numerals.)

L2-cue_272
00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:11.226
#Incidentally, Newton made his proof geometrical like this, and made all his proofs

L2-cue_273
00:20:11.226 --> 00:20:13.596
in his book geometrical, of this type.

L2-cue_274
00:20:13.596 --> 00:20:19.086
Today, we don’t use that kind of reasoning; we use a kind of analytic reasoning with symbols.

L2-cue_275
00:20:19.086 --> 00:20:23.626
This [geometrical] kind of reasoning requires an ingenuity—to draw the right triangles (the

L2-cue_276
00:20:23.626 --> 00:20:27.856
correct triangles, I mean) to notice about the areas—and to figure

L2-cue_277
00:20:27.856 --> 00:20:29.716
out how to do it, you have to be clever.

L2-cue_278
00:20:29.716 --> 00:20:32.416
But there have been improvements in the methods of analysis,

L2-cue_279
00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:38.756
so that one can be quite more stupid—and I write much faster, and much more efficient, then.

L2-cue_280
00:20:38.756 --> 00:20:45.016
I want only to show what it looks like in the notation of the more modern mathematics,

L2-cue_281
00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:48.526
where you don’t do anything but write a lot of symbols to figure it out.

L2-cue_282
00:20:48.526 --> 00:20:51.806
#First, we would like to talk about how fast the area changes,

L2-cue_283
00:20:51.806 --> 00:20:54.166
and we represent that by "area dot".

L2-cue_284
00:20:54.166 --> 00:21:01.226
And the area changes, because when the radius is swinging, it’s the component of velocity

L2-cue_285
00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:05.386
at right angles to the radius, times the radius, that tells how fast the area changes.

L2-cue_286
00:21:05.386 --> 00:21:10.846
So this is the component of the radial distance, multiplied by the velocity,

L2-cue_287
00:21:10.846 --> 00:21:13.916
or rate of change of the distance.

L2-cue_288
00:21:13.916 --> 00:21:17.846
#Now, the question is, whether the rate of change of area itself changes.

L2-cue_289
00:21:17.846 --> 00:21:20.436
The principle, is it’s not supposed to change; the rate of change

L2-cue_290
00:21:20.436 --> 00:21:23.296
of area is not supposed to change.

L2-cue_291
00:21:23.296 --> 00:21:26.846
So we differentiate (so called) this again; it means some little trick

L2-cue_292
00:21:26.846 --> 00:21:29.116
about putting dots in the right place.

L2-cue_293
00:21:29.116 --> 00:21:36.496
And that’s all; you have to learn the tricks—it’s just a series of rules

L2-cue_294
00:21:36.496 --> 00:21:39.626
that people have found out that are very powerful for such a thing.

L2-cue_295
00:21:39.626 --> 00:21:43.476
And this says, the component of the velocity at right angles to the velocity:

L2-cue_296
00:21:43.476 --> 00:21:47.596
it is none-there is none; the velocity is in the same direction as itself.

L2-cue_297
00:21:47.596 --> 00:21:52.166
And the acceleration, which is this thing, the second derivative,

L2-cue_298
00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:56.246
or the derivative of velocity, is the force divided by the mass.

L2-cue_299
00:21:56.246 --> 00:22:00.316
#So this says that the rate of change of the rate of change of the area is the component

L2-cue_300
00:22:00.316 --> 00:22:02.676
of force at right angles to the radius.

L2-cue_301
00:22:02.676 --> 00:22:07.266
But if the force is in a direction of the radius, as Newton said, then there’s no force

L2-cue_302
00:22:07.266 --> 00:22:13.406
at right angles to the radius and that means that the rate of change of area doesn’t change.

L2-cue_303
00:22:13.406 --> 00:22:17.556
#I just wanted to illustrate the different kinds of notation.

L2-cue_304
00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:21.426
#Now, Newton knew how to do this, more or less, with slightly different notation,

L2-cue_305
00:22:21.426 --> 00:22:23.846
but he wrote everything this way because he tried

L2-cue_306
00:22:23.846 --> 00:22:26.916
to make it possible for people to read his papers.

L2-cue_307
00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:31.016
He invented the calculus, which is this kind of mathematics, and is a good illustration

L2-cue_308
00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.096
of the relation of mathematics to physics.

L2-cue_309
00:22:33.096 --> 00:22:38.076
#When the problems in physics get difficult, we may often look to the mathematicians

L2-cue_310
00:22:38.076 --> 00:22:41.786
who have already studied such a thing, and have reasoned about such an item before,

L2-cue_311
00:22:41.786 --> 00:22:44.276
and have prepared a line of reasoning for us to follow.

L2-cue_312
00:22:44.276 --> 00:22:47.626
On the other hand, they may not have—in which case we have to invent our own line

L2-cue_313
00:22:47.626 --> 00:22:50.406
of reasoning, which will then pass back to the mathematicians,

L2-cue_314
00:22:50.406 --> 00:22:55.596
because everybody who reasons carefully about anything is making a contribution

L2-cue_315
00:22:55.596 --> 00:22:57.946
to the knowledge of what happens when you think about something.

L2-cue_316
00:22:57.946 --> 00:23:01.146
And if you abstract it away, and send it to the department of mathematics,

L2-cue_317
00:23:01.146 --> 00:23:05.956
they put it in the books as a branch of mathematics.

L2-cue_318
00:23:05.956 --> 00:23:10.226
#Mathematics, then, is a way of going from one set of statements to another.

L2-cue_319
00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:15.066
It’s evidently useful in physics, because we have all these different ways

L2-cue_320
00:23:15.066 --> 00:23:20.796
that we could speak of things, and it permits us to develop consequences, and analyze situations,

L2-cue_321
00:23:20.796 --> 00:23:25.506
and change the laws in different ways, and to connect all the various statements.

L2-cue_322
00:23:25.506 --> 00:23:29.506
So that, as a matter of fact, the total amount that a physicist knows is very little:

L2-cue_323
00:23:29.506 --> 00:23:31.946
he has only to remember the rules for getting from one place

L2-cue_324
00:23:31.946 --> 00:23:37.046
to another, and he’s able to do it then.

L2-cue_325
00:23:37.046 --> 00:23:39.956
#In other words, all of the various statements—about equal times,

L2-cue_326
00:23:39.956 --> 00:23:44.116
the forces in a direction of the radius, and so on—are all interconnected by reasoning.

L2-cue_327
00:23:44.116 --> 00:23:48.116
Now, an interesting question comes up: is there some pattern to it?

L2-cue_328
00:23:48.116 --> 00:23:54.056
Is there a place to begin—fundamental principles—and deduce the whole works?

L2-cue_329
00:23:54.056 --> 00:23:57.576
Or, is there some particular pattern, or order in nature, in which we can understand

L2-cue_330
00:23:57.576 --> 00:24:02.816
that these are more fundamental statements, and these are more consequential statements?

L2-cue_331
00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:06.586
#There are two kinds of ways of looking at mathematics, which for the purpose

L2-cue_332
00:24:06.586 --> 00:24:11.256
of this lecture I will call the Babylonian tradition, and the Greek tradition.

L2-cue_333
00:24:11.256 --> 00:24:15.606
In Babylonian schools in mathematics, the student would learn something

L2-cue_334
00:24:15.606 --> 00:24:20.986
by doing a large number of examples, until he caught onto the general rule.

L2-cue_335
00:24:20.986 --> 00:24:27.666
Also, a large amount of geometry was known—a lot of properties of circles, Theorem of Pythagoras,

L2-cue_336
00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:34.466
formulas for the areas of cubes and triangles and everything else—and some degree

L2-cue_337
00:24:34.466 --> 00:24:40.886
of argument was available to go from one thing to another.

L2-cue_338
00:24:40.886 --> 00:24:45.626
Tables of numerical quantities were available so that you could solve elaborate equations

L2-cue_339
00:24:45.626 --> 00:24:50.246
and so on-everything was prepared for calculating things out.

L2-cue_340
00:24:50.246 --> 00:24:55.696
But Euclid discovered that there was a way in which all of the theorems

L2-cue_341
00:24:55.696 --> 00:24:59.136
of geometry could be ordered from a set of axioms

L2-cue_342
00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:03.686
that were particularly simple—and you’re all familiar with that much geometry, I’m sure.

L2-cue_343
00:25:03.686 --> 00:25:09.716
#But the Babylonian attitude was—if I make my way of talking what I call Babylonian mathematics—is

L2-cue_344
00:25:09.716 --> 00:25:13.086
that you know all these various theorems and many of the connections in between,

L2-cue_345
00:25:13.086 --> 00:25:18.286
but you’ve never really realized that it could all come up from a bunch of axioms.

L2-cue_346
00:25:18.286 --> 00:25:23.866
#Modern mathematics, the most modern mathematics, concentrates on axioms and demonstrations

L2-cue_347
00:25:23.866 --> 00:25:27.126
within a very definite framework of conventions

L2-cue_348
00:25:27.126 --> 00:25:29.786
of what’s acceptable and not acceptable as axioms.

L2-cue_349
00:25:29.786 --> 00:25:34.196
For example, in geometry, it takes something like Euclid’s axioms (modified

L2-cue_350
00:25:34.196 --> 00:25:37.806
to be made more perfect), and then to show the deduction of the system.

L2-cue_351
00:25:37.806 --> 00:25:41.926
For instance, it would not be expected that a theorem like Pythagoras’—that the sum

L2-cue_352
00:25:41.926 --> 00:25:46.156
of the squares (of the areas of squares) put on the sides of the triangle will equal the area

L2-cue_353
00:25:46.156 --> 00:25:49.526
of a square on a hypotenuse—should be an axiom.

L2-cue_354
00:25:49.526 --> 00:25:53.606
#On the other hand, from another point of view of geometry—that

L2-cue_355
00:25:53.606 --> 00:25:56.336
of Descartes-the Pythagorean Theorem is an axiom.

L2-cue_356
00:25:56.336 --> 00:26:00.096
So the first thing we have to worry about is that, even in mathematics,

L2-cue_357
00:26:00.096 --> 00:26:02.226
you can start in different places.

L2-cue_358
00:26:02.226 --> 00:26:07.196
Because all these various theorems are interconnected by reasoning,

L2-cue_359
00:26:07.196 --> 00:26:12.056
there isn’t any real way to say, "Well, these on the bottom, here, are the bottom,

L2-cue_360
00:26:12.056 --> 00:26:14.146
and these are connected through logic."

L2-cue_361
00:26:14.146 --> 00:26:16.396
Because if you were told this one instead, or this one,

L2-cue_362
00:26:16.396 --> 00:26:18.156
you could also run the logic the other way,

L2-cue_363
00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:20.796
if you weren’t told that one, and work out that one.

L2-cue_364
00:26:20.796 --> 00:26:26.016
It’s like a bridge with lots of members, and it’s overconnected: if pieces have dropped out,

L2-cue_365
00:26:26.016 --> 00:26:28.936
you can reconnect it another way.

L2-cue_366
00:26:28.936 --> 00:26:33.246
#The mathematical tradition of today is to start with some particular ones,

L2-cue_367
00:26:33.246 --> 00:26:35.966
which are chosen by some kind of convention to be axioms,

L2-cue_368
00:26:35.966 --> 00:26:38.176
and then to build up the structure from there.

L2-cue_369
00:26:38.176 --> 00:26:44.396
The "Babylonian" thing that I’m talking about (which I know is really not Babylonian) is

L2-cue_370
00:26:44.396 --> 00:26:48.186
to say, "Well, I happen to know this, and I happen to know that, and maybe I know that,

L2-cue_371
00:26:48.186 --> 00:26:49.576
and I work everything out from there.

L2-cue_372
00:26:49.576 --> 00:26:53.346
And then tomorrow I forgot that this was true, but I remembered that this was true,

L2-cue_373
00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:57.976
and then I reconstruct it again, and so on—I’m never quite sure of where I’m supposed to begin,

L2-cue_374
00:26:57.976 --> 00:27:02.276
and where I’m supposed to end; I just remember enough all the time so that as the memory fades,

L2-cue_375
00:27:02.276 --> 00:27:09.926
and the pieces fall out, I put this thing back together again every day.

L2-cue_376
00:27:09.926 --> 00:27:15.826
#The method of starting from the axioms is not efficient in obtaining the theorems;

L2-cue_377
00:27:15.826 --> 00:27:18.716
in working something out in geometry, you’re not very efficient

L2-cue_378
00:27:18.716 --> 00:27:20.596
if each time you have to start back at the axioms.

L2-cue_379
00:27:20.596 --> 00:27:24.986
But if you have to remember a few things in the geometry, you can always get somewhere else;

L2-cue_380
00:27:24.986 --> 00:27:29.156
it’s much more efficient to do it the other way: what the best axioms are,

L2-cue_381
00:27:29.156 --> 00:27:33.296
are not exactly the same—in fact, are not ever the same—as the most efficient way

L2-cue_382
00:27:33.296 --> 00:27:36.806
of getting around in the territory.

L2-cue_383
00:27:36.806 --> 00:27:41.056
In physics, we need the Babylonian method, and not the Euclidean

L2-cue_384
00:27:41.056 --> 00:27:44.756
or Greek method, and I would like to say why.

L2-cue_385
00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:49.136
#The problem in the Euclidean method is to make something

L2-cue_386
00:27:49.136 --> 00:27:52.636
about the axioms a little bit more interesting or important.

L2-cue_387
00:27:52.636 --> 00:27:56.016
But the question that we have is, in the case of gravitation,

L2-cue_388
00:27:56.016 --> 00:28:00.906
is it more important—is it more basic, is it more fundamental, is it a better axiom—to say

L2-cue_389
00:28:00.906 --> 00:28:07.726
that the force is directed toward the sun, or to say that equal areas are swept in equal time?

L2-cue_390
00:28:07.726 --> 00:28:11.466
#Well, from one point of view, the force is better,

L2-cue_391
00:28:11.466 --> 00:28:16.356
because once I state what the forces are, I can deal with a system with many particles,

L2-cue_392
00:28:16.356 --> 00:28:19.056
in which the orbits are no longer ellipses—because of the pull of one

L2-cue_393
00:28:19.056 --> 00:28:22.076
on the other-and the theorem about equal areas fails.

L2-cue_394
00:28:22.076 --> 00:28:27.006
Therefore, I think that the force law ought to be an axiom, instead of the other.

L2-cue_395
00:28:27.006 --> 00:28:29.436
#On the other hand, the principle that equal times is swept

L2-cue_396
00:28:29.436 --> 00:28:34.536
out in equal—equal areas are swept out in equal times—can be generalized, when there’s a system

L2-cue_397
00:28:34.536 --> 00:28:39.846
of a large number of particles, to another theorem (which I had prepared to explain,

L2-cue_398
00:28:39.846 --> 00:28:42.676
but I see I’m running out of time): there’s another statement,

L2-cue_399
00:28:42.676 --> 00:28:46.246
which is a little more general than equal areas in equal time.

L2-cue_400
00:28:46.246 --> 00:28:47.836
#Well, I have to state what it is.

L2-cue_401
00:28:47.836 --> 00:28:51.506
It’s rather complicated to say, and it’s not quite as pretty as this one,

L2-cue_402
00:28:51.506 --> 00:28:58.356
but it’s obviously the son of this one—I mean it’s the offspring.

L2-cue_403
00:28:58.356 --> 00:29:02.276
If you look at all these particles—Jupiter, Saturn, the sun,

L2-cue_404
00:29:02.276 --> 00:29:05.856
and all these things going around; lots of stars, or whatever they are,

L2-cue_405
00:29:05.856 --> 00:29:10.286
all interacting with each other—and look at it from far away, and project it on a plane

L2-cue_406
00:29:10.286 --> 00:29:14.316
like this picture, then everything is moving—this moving this way,

L2-cue_407
00:29:14.316 --> 00:29:16.266
and that moving that way, and so on.

L2-cue_408
00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:23.626
#Then take any point at all—say this point—and then calculate how much each one is changing its

L2-cue_409
00:29:23.626 --> 00:29:26.536
area-how much area is being swept out by the radius

L2-cue_410
00:29:26.536 --> 00:29:30.606
to every particle, and add them all together.

L2-cue_411
00:29:30.606 --> 00:29:36.296
But wait: those masses which are heavier—this is twice as heavy as this one;

L2-cue_412
00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:39.246
then this area counts twice as much.

L2-cue_413
00:29:39.246 --> 00:29:42.676
So you count each of the areas that are being swept out in proportion

L2-cue_414
00:29:42.676 --> 00:29:47.776
to the mass that’s doing the sweeping, and the total of all of that is not changing

L2-cue_415
00:29:47.776 --> 00:29:50.936
in time-that’s a generalization, obviously, of the other one.

L2-cue_416
00:29:50.936 --> 00:29:54.876
Incidentally, the total of that is called the angular momentum, and this is called the law

L2-cue_417
00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:56.636
of conservation of angular momentum.

L2-cue_418
00:29:56.636 --> 00:30:01.646
("Conservation" just means that it doesn’t change.)

L2-cue_419
00:30:01.646 --> 00:30:07.396
#Now, one of the consequences of this is—just to show what it’s good for—imagine a lot

L2-cue_420
00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:11.666
of stars falling together to form a nebula or a galaxy.

L2-cue_421
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:17.676
As they come closer in—if they were very far out, and moving slowly so there was a little bit

L2-cue_422
00:30:17.676 --> 00:30:22.856
of area being generated but on very long arms (distances from the center),

L2-cue_423
00:30:22.856 --> 00:30:25.036
then if the thing falls in, the distances

L2-cue_424
00:30:25.036 --> 00:30:31.426
to the center are shorter now (if all the stars are now close in), then these radii are smaller.

L2-cue_425
00:30:31.426 --> 00:30:35.686
And in order to sweep out the same area, they have to go a lot faster.

L2-cue_426
00:30:35.686 --> 00:30:40.476
So as the things come in, they swing—swirl around—and thus we can roughly understand the

L2-cue_427
00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:42.826
qualitative shape of the spiral nebulae.

L2-cue_428
00:30:42.826 --> 00:30:49.566
#You can also understand, in the same way—exactly the same way—the way a skater spins:

L2-cue_429
00:30:49.566 --> 00:30:53.706
when you start with a leg out, moving slowly, and as you pull the leg in,

L2-cue_430
00:30:53.706 --> 00:30:57.116
it spins faster (because when the leg is out, it’s contributing, when it’s moving slowly,

L2-cue_431
00:30:57.116 --> 00:31:01.326
a certain amount of area per second), and then, when it comes in,

L2-cue_432
00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:03.626
to get the same area you have to go around faster.

L2-cue_433
00:31:03.626 --> 00:31:11.196
But I didn’t prove it for the skater: the skater uses muscle force;

L2-cue_434
00:31:11.196 --> 00:31:15.946
gravity is a different force—yet it’s proof for the skater.

L2-cue_435
00:31:15.946 --> 00:31:21.596
#Now we have a problem: we can deduce often from one part of physics,

L2-cue_436
00:31:21.596 --> 00:31:24.676
like the law of gravitation, a principle which turns

L2-cue_437
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:28.616
out to be much more valid than the derivation!

L2-cue_438
00:31:28.616 --> 00:31:32.116
This doesn’t happen in mathematics—that theorems come out in places

L2-cue_439
00:31:32.116 --> 00:31:33.386
where they’re not supposed to be.

L2-cue_440
00:31:33.386 --> 00:31:39.706
In other words, if we were to say that the postulates of physics were this law

L2-cue_441
00:31:39.706 --> 00:31:44.276
of gravitation, we could deduce the conservation of angular momentum, but only for gravitation.

L2-cue_442
00:31:44.276 --> 00:31:47.306
But we discover experimentally that the conservation

L2-cue_443
00:31:47.306 --> 00:31:50.076
of angular momentum is a much wider thing.

L2-cue_444
00:31:50.076 --> 00:31:55.056
#Now, Newton had other postulates by which he could get the more general conservation law

L2-cue_445
00:31:55.056 --> 00:31:59.456
of angular momentum, but Newtonian laws were wrong: there’s no forces;

L2-cue_446
00:31:59.456 --> 00:32:03.086
it’s all a lot of baloney; the particles don’t have orbits, and so on.

L2-cue_447
00:32:03.086 --> 00:32:09.186
Yet, the analog-the exact transformation of this principle about the area as the conservation

L2-cue_448
00:32:09.186 --> 00:32:15.066
of angular momentum-is true for the atomic motions in quantum mechanics-and is still,

L2-cue_449
00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:17.896
as far as we can tell today, exact.

L2-cue_450
00:32:17.896 --> 00:32:22.366
#So we have these wide principles which sweep across all the different laws,

L2-cue_451
00:32:22.366 --> 00:32:27.386
and if one takes too seriously his derivations, and feels that this is only valid

L2-cue_452
00:32:27.386 --> 00:32:31.166
because this is valid, you cannot understand the interconnections

L2-cue_453
00:32:31.166 --> 00:32:32.966
of the different branches of physics.

L2-cue_454
00:32:32.966 --> 00:32:38.406
Someday, when physics is complete, then maybe with this kind of argument we know all the laws,

L2-cue_455
00:32:38.406 --> 00:32:41.976
then we could start with some axioms—and no doubt somebody will figure out a particular way

L2-cue_456
00:32:41.976 --> 00:32:44.996
of doing it, and then all of the deductions will be made.

L2-cue_457
00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:48.386
But while we don’t know all the laws, we can use some to make guesses

L2-cue_458
00:32:48.386 --> 00:32:52.796
at theorems, which extend beyond the proof.

L2-cue_459
00:32:52.796 --> 00:32:58.426
#So in order to understand the physics, one must always have a neat balance and contain

L2-cue_460
00:32:58.426 --> 00:33:02.436
in his head all of the various propositions and their interrelationships,

L2-cue_461
00:33:02.436 --> 00:33:05.836
because the laws often extend beyond the range of their deductions.

L2-cue_462
00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:11.796
This will only have no importance when all the laws are known.

L2-cue_463
00:33:11.796 --> 00:33:14.766
#Another thing that’s interesting in the relation of mathematics

L2-cue_464
00:33:14.766 --> 00:33:22.606
to physics is this—a very strange thing: that by mathematical arguments you can show

L2-cue_465
00:33:22.606 --> 00:33:25.726
that you can start from very many different apparent starting points,

L2-cue_466
00:33:25.726 --> 00:33:27.546
and come to the same thing.

L2-cue_467
00:33:27.546 --> 00:33:32.046
That’s pretty clear, if you have axioms; you can use some of the theorems.

L2-cue_468
00:33:32.046 --> 00:33:37.686
But actually, the physical laws are so delicately constructed that the statements

L2-cue_469
00:33:37.686 --> 00:33:40.956
of them have such qualitatively different characters, that it’s very interesting.

L2-cue_470
00:33:40.956 --> 00:33:46.466
#So, if you’ll permit me, I’m going to state the law of gravitation in three different ways—all

L2-cue_471
00:33:46.466 --> 00:33:52.026
of which are exactly equivalent, it turns out—but they sound completely different.

L2-cue_472
00:33:52.026 --> 00:33:56.956
#One: there’s the forces between the objects as described before, and each object,

L2-cue_473
00:33:56.956 --> 00:34:00.296
when it sees the force on it, accelerates—or changes its motion,

L2-cue_474
00:34:00.296 --> 00:34:02.506
rather—at a certain amount per second,

L2-cue_475
00:34:02.506 --> 00:34:05.636
as I’ve described before—the regular way; I call it Newton’s Law.

L2-cue_476
00:34:05.636 --> 00:34:11.366
#Now, there’s a completely different way: that law says that the force depends

L2-cue_477
00:34:11.366 --> 00:34:14.976
on something at a finite distance away.

L2-cue_478
00:34:14.976 --> 00:34:17.606
See, it has what we call an "unlocal" quality:

L2-cue_479
00:34:17.606 --> 00:34:20.196
the force on this depends on where that one is over there.

L2-cue_480
00:34:20.196 --> 00:34:25.136
Now, you may not like the idea of action at a distance—that it can "know" what’s going

L2-cue_481
00:34:25.136 --> 00:34:29.386
on over there-so then there’s another way of stating the laws, which are very strange,

L2-cue_482
00:34:29.386 --> 00:34:34.446
and it’s called the field way of representing the laws—and it’s so very hard to explain,

L2-cue_483
00:34:34.446 --> 00:34:37.626
but I just want to give you some rough idea of what it’s like.

L2-cue_484
00:34:37.626 --> 00:34:42.446
#And it says a different thing, a completely different thing: that there’s a number

L2-cue_485
00:34:42.446 --> 00:34:45.806
at every point in space—I know it’s a number; it’s not a mechanism;

L2-cue_486
00:34:45.806 --> 00:34:48.786
it’s the trouble with this whole physics, that it must be mathematical.

L2-cue_487
00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:54.316
There’s a number at every point in space—here’s a number, here’s a number, and so on.

L2-cue_488
00:34:54.316 --> 00:34:58.476
And the number is changing—it changes, rather—when you go from place to place.

L2-cue_489
00:34:58.476 --> 00:35:04.046
If an object is placed at one of these points somewhere in space, the force on it is

L2-cue_490
00:35:04.046 --> 00:35:09.066
in a direction in which that number—I’ll call it the name it’s given, called a potential—is

L2-cue_491
00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:13.286
in the direction in which that potential changes as quick as it can.

L2-cue_492
00:35:13.286 --> 00:35:16.706
And the force is proportional to how fast it changes as you move.

L2-cue_493
00:35:16.706 --> 00:35:20.036
That’s one statement; that’s not enough, yet, because I have to tell you, now,

L2-cue_494
00:35:20.036 --> 00:35:22.956
how to determine how the potential varies.

L2-cue_495
00:35:22.956 --> 00:35:27.056
I could say the potential varies as 1 over the distance from each object,

L2-cue_496
00:35:27.056 --> 00:35:31.586
but that’s back to the action—at—a—distance idea.

L2-cue_497
00:35:31.586 --> 00:35:34.926
#However—the force is at a distance, but—you can state the law in another way,

L2-cue_498
00:35:34.926 --> 00:35:39.916
and it says the following: you don’t have to know what’s going on anywhere outside

L2-cue_499
00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:45.076
of a little ball; if you want to know what the potential is here, you tell me what it is

L2-cue_500
00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:49.166
on the surface of any ball, no matter how small—you don’t have to look outside,

L2-cue_501
00:35:49.166 --> 00:35:49.956
you just tell me what it is

L2-cue_502
00:35:49.956 --> 00:35:53.076
in the neighborhood—and how much mass there is in the ball.

L2-cue_503
00:35:53.076 --> 00:36:01.956
#The rule is this: that the potential at the center is equal to the average of the potential

L2-cue_504
00:36:01.956 --> 00:36:09.436
on the little ball surface, minus this constant (that’s over there on the other equation),

L2-cue_505
00:36:09.436 --> 00:36:13.796
divided by twice the radius of the ball (let’s suppose the radius of the ball is called a),

L2-cue_506
00:36:13.796 --> 00:36:19.736
and then multiplied by the mass that’s inside the ball—if the ball is small enough.

L2-cue_507
00:36:19.736 --> 00:36:25.086
#Now you see that this law is different than the other one, because it only tells what happens

L2-cue_508
00:36:25.086 --> 00:36:28.726
at one point in terms of what happens very close by.

L2-cue_509
00:36:28.726 --> 00:36:32.806
Newton’s laws tell what happens at one time in terms of what happens

L2-cue_510
00:36:32.806 --> 00:36:36.436
at another instant—it skips from instant to instant, how to work it out—but

L2-cue_511
00:36:36.436 --> 00:36:39.016
in space it leaps from place to place.

L2-cue_512
00:36:39.016 --> 00:36:43.406
But this thing is both local in time, and also local in space,

L2-cue_513
00:36:43.406 --> 00:36:45.576
because it depends only on what’s in the neighborhood.

L2-cue_514
00:36:45.576 --> 00:36:49.736
#And [so] there’s another way

L2-cue_515
00:36:49.736 --> 00:36:53.426
of representing—that’s another way—a completely different way.

L2-cue_516
00:36:53.426 --> 00:36:57.956
See, there’s a difference in the philosophy, in the qualitative ideas involved.

L2-cue_517
00:36:57.956 --> 00:36:59.306
You don’t like action at a distance?

L2-cue_518
00:36:59.306 --> 00:37:00.926
You can get away without it.

L2-cue_519
00:37:00.926 --> 00:37:04.616
#Now I’ll show you one which is philosophically the exact opposite,

L2-cue_520
00:37:04.616 --> 00:37:08.886
in which there’s no discussion at all about how the thing works its way from place to place,

L2-cue_521
00:37:08.886 --> 00:37:12.546
in which the whole thing is an overall statement, and goes as follows:

L2-cue_522
00:37:12.546 --> 00:37:18.246
when you have other particles around, and you want to know how this one moves from one place

L2-cue_523
00:37:18.246 --> 00:37:24.176
to another, you do it as follows.

L2-cue_524
00:37:24.176 --> 00:37:29.946
#You calculate a certain quantity for—you invent a possible motion that gets from one given place

L2-cue_525
00:37:29.946 --> 00:37:33.656
to some other place that you’re interested in, in a given amount of time.

L2-cue_526
00:37:33.656 --> 00:37:37.456
Say it wants to go from here to here in an hour, and you want to know by what route it can get

L2-cue_527
00:37:37.456 --> 00:37:40.276
from there to there in an hour—by what curve.

L2-cue_528
00:37:40.276 --> 00:37:44.906
#So what you do is, you calculate a quantity, guessing the curve; if you try this curve,

L2-cue_529
00:37:44.906 --> 00:37:47.126
you calculate a certain number for this quantity.

L2-cue_530
00:37:47.126 --> 00:37:51.636
(I don’t want to just tell you what the quantity is, but for those who have heard of these terms,

L2-cue_531
00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:54.996
this quantity on this route is the average of the difference

L2-cue_532
00:37:54.996 --> 00:37:58.266
between the kinetic and potential energy.)

L2-cue_533
00:37:58.266 --> 00:38:03.166
Now, if you calculate this quantity for this route, then for another route, you’ll get,

L2-cue_534
00:38:03.166 --> 00:38:06.376
of course, different numbers for the answer.

L2-cue_535
00:38:06.376 --> 00:38:11.266
But there’s one route which gives the least possible number for that,

L2-cue_536
00:38:11.266 --> 00:38:14.326
and that’s the route that the particle takes.

L2-cue_537
00:38:14.326 --> 00:38:18.406
#Now we’re describing the actual motion—the ellipse—by saying something

L2-cue_538
00:38:18.406 --> 00:38:20.486
about the whole curve.

L2-cue_539
00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:23.506
We have lost the idea of causality—that the particle is here,

L2-cue_540
00:38:23.506 --> 00:38:25.666
it sees the pull, it moves to here.

L2-cue_541
00:38:25.666 --> 00:38:31.036
Instead of that, in some grand fashion, it "smells" all the curves

L2-cue_542
00:38:31.036 --> 00:38:38.336
around here—all the possibilities—and "decides" which one to take.

L2-cue_543
00:38:38.336 --> 00:38:43.886
#This is an example of the wide range of beautiful ways of describing nature.

L2-cue_544
00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:47.766
And that when people talk that nature must have causality—well,

L2-cue_545
00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:52.936
you could talk about it this way; nature must be stated in terms of a minimum principle—well,

L2-cue_546
00:38:52.936 --> 00:38:58.896
you can talk about it this way; nature must have a local field—so it can do that, and so on.

L2-cue_547
00:38:58.896 --> 00:39:03.836
And the question is, which one is right?

L2-cue_548
00:39:03.836 --> 00:39:10.226
#Now, if these various alternatives are mathematically not exactly equivalent,

L2-cue_549
00:39:10.226 --> 00:39:15.516
and if for certain ones there will be different consequences than for others,

L2-cue_550
00:39:15.516 --> 00:39:19.466
then that’s perfectly all right, because we have only to do the experiments to find

L2-cue_551
00:39:19.466 --> 00:39:24.096
out which way nature actually chooses to do it.

L2-cue_552
00:39:24.096 --> 00:39:27.356
Mostly, people come along and they argue philosophically they like this one better

L2-cue_553
00:39:27.356 --> 00:39:31.676
than that one, but we have learned from much experience that all intuitions

L2-cue_554
00:39:31.676 --> 00:39:38.036
about what nature’s going to do philosophically fail—it never works.

L2-cue_555
00:39:38.036 --> 00:39:42.636
One just has to work out all the possibilities, and just try all the alternatives.

L2-cue_556
00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:45.636
Now, in this particular case that I’m talking about here,

L2-cue_557
00:39:45.636 --> 00:39:48.696
these theories are exactly equivalent.

L2-cue_558
00:39:48.696 --> 00:39:51.916
The mathematical consequences in every one of the different formulations

L2-cue_559
00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:54.526
of the three formulations—Newton’s laws, the local field method,

L2-cue_560
00:39:54.526 --> 00:39:59.096
and this minimum principle—give exactly the same consequences.

L2-cue_561
00:39:59.096 --> 00:40:00.536
What do we do then?

L2-cue_562
00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:04.696
You will read in all the books that we therefore cannot decide scientifically

L2-cue_563
00:40:04.696 --> 00:40:06.886
on one or the other.

L2-cue_564
00:40:06.886 --> 00:40:08.366
That’s true.

L2-cue_565
00:40:08.366 --> 00:40:11.626
#They’re not equivalent—they are equivalent, scientifically;

L2-cue_566
00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:16.736
it is impossible to make a decision, because there’s no experimental way to distinguish

L2-cue_567
00:40:16.736 --> 00:40:19.376
if all the consequences are the same.

L2-cue_568
00:40:19.376 --> 00:40:21.496
Psychologically they’re very different in two ways.

L2-cue_569
00:40:21.496 --> 00:40:23.366
First, philosophically, you like them or don’t

L2-cue_570
00:40:23.366 --> 00:40:29.296
like them-training is the only thing you can do to beat that disease.

L2-cue_571
00:40:29.296 --> 00:40:36.136
Second, psychologically they’re different because they’re completely unequivalent

L2-cue_572
00:40:36.136 --> 00:40:38.916
when you go to guess at a new law.

L2-cue_573
00:40:38.916 --> 00:40:42.646
As long as physics is incomplete, and we’re trying to find out the other laws,

L2-cue_574
00:40:42.646 --> 00:40:48.046
and to understand the other laws, then the different possible formulations give clues

L2-cue_575
00:40:48.046 --> 00:40:50.156
as to what might happen in another circumstance.

L2-cue_576
00:40:50.156 --> 00:40:55.536
And they become not equivalent in psychologically suggesting to us to guess

L2-cue_577
00:40:55.536 --> 00:40:59.796
as to what the laws might look like in a wider situation.

L2-cue_578
00:40:59.796 --> 00:41:05.456
#For instance, Einstein noticed that the law of gravity—he said that he realized

L2-cue_579
00:41:05.456 --> 00:41:10.486
that signals couldn’t propagate faster than the speed of light for light, [or] for electricity.

L2-cue_580
00:41:10.486 --> 00:41:14.506
He guessed that it was a general principle—the same guessing game

L2-cue_581
00:41:14.506 --> 00:41:17.596
as taking this angular momentum, and extending it from one case

L2-cue_582
00:41:17.596 --> 00:41:19.626
where you proved it, to the rest of the universe.

L2-cue_583
00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:23.626
He guessed that it was true of everything, and he guessed that it would be true of gravitation.

L2-cue_584
00:41:23.626 --> 00:41:29.016
If the signals can’t go any faster than the speed of light, it turns out that the method

L2-cue_585
00:41:29.016 --> 00:41:32.406
of describing the forces instantaneously is very poor.

L2-cue_586
00:41:32.406 --> 00:41:36.006
And in the Einstein generalization of gravitation,

L2-cue_587
00:41:36.006 --> 00:41:41.976
this method of describing physics is hopelessly inadequate and enormously complicated, whereas,

L2-cue_588
00:41:41.976 --> 00:41:46.756
this one is neat and simple—and so is this one—so we haven’t decided between those two yet.

L2-cue_589
00:41:46.756 --> 00:41:52.726
#In fact, it turns out that the quantum mechanics says that, exactly as I stated them,

L2-cue_590
00:41:52.726 --> 00:41:59.536
neither is right—but the fact that a minimum principle exists turns out to be a consequence

L2-cue_591
00:41:59.536 --> 00:42:04.316
of the fact that, on a small scale, particles obey quantum mechanics.

L2-cue_592
00:42:04.316 --> 00:42:09.966
And the fact is, the best laws, as presently understood, are really a combination of the two,

L2-cue_593
00:42:09.966 --> 00:42:14.796
in which we use minimum principles plus local force—local laws.

L2-cue_594
00:42:14.796 --> 00:42:19.596
And present day believes that the laws of physics have to have the local character,

L2-cue_595
00:42:19.596 --> 00:42:28.836
and also the minimum principle—but we don’t really know.

L2-cue_596
00:42:28.836 --> 00:42:36.056
#So, it’s this way: if you have a structure that’s only partly accurate,

L2-cue_597
00:42:36.056 --> 00:42:40.326
and something is going to fail, if you write it with just the right axioms,

L2-cue_598
00:42:40.326 --> 00:42:44.456
maybe only one axiom fails—and the rest remain; you [only have to] change one little thing.

L2-cue_599
00:42:44.456 --> 00:42:47.196
But if you write it with another set of axioms,

L2-cue_600
00:42:47.196 --> 00:42:50.996
they all collapse, because they all lean on that.

L2-cue_601
00:42:50.996 --> 00:42:55.656
But we can’t tell ahead of time, without some intuition and guesswork,

L2-cue_602
00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.876
as to which is the best way to write it, until we find out the new situation.

L2-cue_603
00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:02.646
So we must, therefore, always keep all of the alternative ways of looking at the thing

L2-cue_604
00:43:02.646 --> 00:43:08.526
in our heads; so the physicists do "Babylonian" mathematics, and pay little attention

L2-cue_605
00:43:08.526 --> 00:43:13.226
to the precise reasoning from fixed axioms.

L2-cue_606
00:43:13.226 --> 00:43:16.486
#One of the amazing characteristics of nature is this variety

L2-cue_607
00:43:16.486 --> 00:43:19.466
of interpretational schemes which is possible.

L2-cue_608
00:43:19.466 --> 00:43:23.626
It turns out that it’s only possible because the laws are just so, and special, and delicate.

L2-cue_609
00:43:23.626 --> 00:43:28.756
For instance, that the law is the inverse square is what permits it

L2-cue_610
00:43:28.756 --> 00:43:33.186
to become local-if it were the inverse cube, it couldn’t be done this way.

L2-cue_611
00:43:33.186 --> 00:43:36.676
That the other end of the equation—that the force is related to the rate of change

L2-cue_612
00:43:36.676 --> 00:43:44.386
of the velocity-that permits this kind of a way of writing the laws (the minimum principle),

L2-cue_613
00:43:44.386 --> 00:43:49.086
because if, for instance, the force were proportional to the rate of change

L2-cue_614
00:43:49.086 --> 00:43:54.596
of position instead of velocity, you couldn’t write it in that way.

L2-cue_615
00:43:54.596 --> 00:43:59.256
If you try to modify the laws much, you find you can only write them in very much fewer ways.

L2-cue_616
00:43:59.256 --> 00:44:03.906
I always find that mysterious—and I don’t understand the reason why it is—that the laws

L2-cue_617
00:44:03.906 --> 00:44:08.336
of physics always seem to be possible to be expressed in such a tremendous variety

L2-cue_618
00:44:08.336 --> 00:44:18.596
of ways-they seem to be able to get through several wickets at the same time.

L2-cue_619
00:44:18.596 --> 00:44:22.876
#Now, I would like to make a number of remarks on the relation of mathematics

L2-cue_620
00:44:22.876 --> 00:44:25.596
and physics, which are a little more general.

L2-cue_621
00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:33.016
The first is, that the mathematicians only are dealing with the structure of the reasoning,

L2-cue_622
00:44:33.016 --> 00:44:37.216
and they do not really care about what they’re talking.

L2-cue_623
00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:39.886
They don’t even need to know what they’re talking about—or,

L2-cue_624
00:44:39.886 --> 00:44:43.306
as they themselves say, whether what they say is true.

L2-cue_625
00:44:43.306 --> 00:44:44.866
Now, I explain that.

L2-cue_626
00:44:44.866 --> 00:44:50.136
#If you state the axioms—you say: such—and—such is so, and such—and—such is so,

L2-cue_627
00:44:50.136 --> 00:44:54.956
and such—and—such is so; what then?—then the logic can be carried

L2-cue_628
00:44:54.956 --> 00:45:00.396
out without knowing what the "such—and—such" words mean.

L2-cue_629
00:45:00.396 --> 00:45:07.356
That is, if the statements about the axioms are carefully formulated, and are complete enough,

L2-cue_630
00:45:07.356 --> 00:45:09.516
it is not necessary for the man who is doing the reasoning

L2-cue_631
00:45:09.516 --> 00:45:12.736
to have any knowledge of the meaning of these words.

L2-cue_632
00:45:12.736 --> 00:45:17.106
#And he’ll be able to deduce, in the same language, new conclusions:

L2-cue_633
00:45:17.106 --> 00:45:20.146
if I use the word "triangle" in one of the axioms, there’d be some statement

L2-cue_634
00:45:20.146 --> 00:45:21.916
about "triangles" in the conclusion.

L2-cue_635
00:45:21.916 --> 00:45:25.556
Whereas, the man who’s doing the reasoning might not know what the "triangle" is.

L2-cue_636
00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.216
But then I can read his thing back and say, "Oh, a triangle—well,

L2-cue_637
00:45:28.216 --> 00:45:32.556
that’s just a three—sided what—have—you that’s a so—and—so"—and so I know this new fact.

L2-cue_638
00:45:32.556 --> 00:45:36.996
In other words, mathematicians prepare abstract reasoning that’s ready to be used

L2-cue_639
00:45:36.996 --> 00:45:40.116
if you will only have a set of axioms about the real world.

L2-cue_640
00:45:40.116 --> 00:45:43.716
But the physicist has meaning to all the phrases.

L2-cue_641
00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:47.576
#And there’s a very important thing that the people who—a lot of people who—study physics

L2-cue_642
00:45:47.576 --> 00:45:51.456
that come from mathematics don’t appreciate: that physics is not mathematics,

L2-cue_643
00:45:51.456 --> 00:45:56.026
and mathematics is not physics; one helps the other.

L2-cue_644
00:45:56.026 --> 00:45:59.616
#But [In physics] you have to have some understanding of the connection of the words

L2-cue_645
00:45:59.616 --> 00:46:04.316
with the real world: it’s necessary, at the end, to translate what you figured

L2-cue_646
00:46:04.316 --> 00:46:10.286
out into English-into the world, into the blocks of copper and glass that you’re going

L2-cue_647
00:46:10.286 --> 00:46:14.686
to do the experiments with—to find out whether the consequences are true.

L2-cue_648
00:46:14.686 --> 00:46:21.916
This is a problem which is not a problem with mathematics at all.

L2-cue_649
00:46:21.916 --> 00:46:24.856
#I’ve already mentioned the only other relationship that—of course,

L2-cue_650
00:46:24.856 --> 00:46:27.616
it’s obvious how the mathematical reasonings which have been developed are

L2-cue_651
00:46:27.616 --> 00:46:31.396
of great power and use for physicists.

L2-cue_652
00:46:31.396 --> 00:46:37.356
On the other hand, sometimes the physicist’s reasoning is useful for mathematicians.

L2-cue_653
00:46:37.356 --> 00:46:42.046
Mathematicians also like to make their reasoning as general as possible.

L2-cue_654
00:46:42.046 --> 00:46:45.586
If you say I have a three dimensional space—an ordinary space,

L2-cue_655
00:46:45.586 --> 00:46:48.796
I want to talk about ordinary space, you know, you’re in it, you measure distances

L2-cue_656
00:46:48.796 --> 00:46:52.636
and there are three numbers you need to tell where something is, you go breadth,

L2-cue_657
00:46:52.636 --> 00:46:58.086
width and height, three dimensional space—and you begin to ask him about theorems.

L2-cue_658
00:46:58.086 --> 00:47:02.456
Then they say, "Now look, if you had a space of n dimensions, then here are the theorems."

L2-cue_659
00:47:02.456 --> 00:47:04.136
"Well, yeah, but I only want the case 3."

L2-cue_660
00:47:04.136 --> 00:47:14.896
"Well, substitute n = 3"—and then it turns out that very many

L2-cue_661
00:47:14.896 --> 00:47:17.336
of the complicated theorems they have are much simpler,

L2-cue_662
00:47:17.336 --> 00:47:19.546
because it happens to be a special case.

L2-cue_663
00:47:19.546 --> 00:47:23.176
#Now, the physicist is always interested in the special case;

L2-cue_664
00:47:23.176 --> 00:47:25.976
he’s never interested in the general case.

L2-cue_665
00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:31.846
He’s talking about something; he’s not talking abstractly about anything;

L2-cue_666
00:47:31.846 --> 00:47:36.106
he knows what he’s talking about: he wants to discuss the gravity law;

L2-cue_667
00:47:36.106 --> 00:47:39.916
he doesn’t want the arbitrary force case; he wants the gravity law.

L2-cue_668
00:47:39.916 --> 00:47:43.366
And so there’s a certain amount of reducing

L2-cue_669
00:47:43.366 --> 00:47:46.566
because the mathematicians have prepared these things for a wide range

L2-cue_670
00:47:46.566 --> 00:47:48.326
of problems, which is very useful.

L2-cue_671
00:47:48.326 --> 00:47:52.476
And later on, it always turns out that the poor physicist has to come back and say, "Excuse me,

L2-cue_672
00:47:52.476 --> 00:48:11.476
when you wanted to tell me about the four dimensions..."

L2-cue_673
00:48:11.476 --> 00:48:13.446
#Now, another item that’s interesting

L2-cue_674
00:48:13.446 --> 00:48:18.866
in this relationship is the question of how to do new physics.

L2-cue_675
00:48:18.866 --> 00:48:23.986
Is it important to have a feeling, a kind of intuition—oh, I must mention one other item:

L2-cue_676
00:48:23.986 --> 00:48:27.246
when you know what it is you’re talking about—that these things are forces,

L2-cue_677
00:48:27.246 --> 00:48:31.516
and these are masses, and this is inertia, and this is so on—then you can use an awful lot

L2-cue_678
00:48:31.516 --> 00:48:35.956
of commonsense seat—of—the—pants feeling about the world: you’ve seen various things;

L2-cue_679
00:48:35.956 --> 00:48:39.666
you know more or less how the phenomenon is going to behave.

L2-cue_680
00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:42.736
#Well, the poor mathematician, he translates it into equations,

L2-cue_681
00:48:42.736 --> 00:48:45.516
and the symbols don’t mean anything to him, and he has no guide

L2-cue_682
00:48:45.516 --> 00:48:49.386
but precise mathematical rigor and care in the argument.

L2-cue_683
00:48:49.386 --> 00:48:52.726
Whereas the physicist, who knows more or less how the answer is going to come out,

L2-cue_684
00:48:52.726 --> 00:48:58.566
can sort of guess part way and go right along rather rapidly—the mathematical rigor

L2-cue_685
00:48:58.566 --> 00:49:03.666
of great precision is not very useful in the physics, nor is the modern attitude

L2-cue_686
00:49:03.666 --> 00:49:05.956
in mathematics to look at axioms.

L2-cue_687
00:49:05.956 --> 00:49:08.226
#Now, mathematicians can do what they want to do.

L2-cue_688
00:49:08.226 --> 00:49:11.966
One should not criticize them, because they are not slaves to physics.

L2-cue_689
00:49:11.966 --> 00:49:16.256
It is not necessary that, just because this would be useful to you, they have to do it

L2-cue_690
00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:21.096
that way; they can do what they will—it’s their own job—and

L2-cue_691
00:49:21.096 --> 00:49:24.386
if you want something else, then you work it out yourself.

L2-cue_692
00:49:24.386 --> 00:49:32.016
#The next point is the question of whether we should guess, when we try to get a new law,

L2-cue_693
00:49:32.016 --> 00:49:36.096
whether we should use a seat—of—the—pants feeling, and philosophical principle—I don’t

L2-cue_694
00:49:36.096 --> 00:49:41.336
like a minimum principle, or I do like a minimum principle; or I don’t like action at a distance,

L2-cue_695
00:49:41.336 --> 00:49:47.506
or I do like action—the question is, to what extent models help.

L2-cue_696
00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:52.596
It’s a very interesting thing: very often, models help—and most physics teachers try

L2-cue_697
00:49:52.596 --> 00:49:55.556
to teach how to use these models and get a good "physical feel"

L2-cue_698
00:49:55.556 --> 00:49:58.326
for how things are going to work out.

L2-cue_699
00:49:58.326 --> 00:50:01.506
But the greatest discoveries, it always turns out,

L2-cue_700
00:50:01.506 --> 00:50:03.766
abstract away from the model; it never did any good.

L2-cue_701
00:50:03.766 --> 00:50:08.686
Maxwell’s discovery of electrodynamics was first made with a lot of imaginary wheels and idlers

L2-cue_702
00:50:08.686 --> 00:50:11.506
and everything else in space; if you got rid of all the idlers

L2-cue_703
00:50:11.506 --> 00:50:14.886
and everything else in space, the thing was okay.

L2-cue_704
00:50:14.886 --> 00:50:17.496
Dirac discovered the correct laws

L2-cue_705
00:50:17.496 --> 00:50:22.736
of quantum mechanics—for relativity quantum mechanics—simply by guessing the equation.

L2-cue_706
00:50:22.736 --> 00:50:28.336
The method of guessing the equation seems to be a pretty effective way of guessing new laws.

L2-cue_707
00:50:28.336 --> 00:50:33.606
This shows, again, that mathematics is a deep way of expressing nature,

L2-cue_708
00:50:33.606 --> 00:50:37.106
and attempts to express nature in philosophical principles,

L2-cue_709
00:50:37.106 --> 00:50:41.336
or in seat-of-the-pants mechanical feelings, is not an efficient way.

L2-cue_710
00:50:41.336 --> 00:50:49.846
#I must say, that it is possible—and I’ve often made the hypothesis—that physics ultimately will

L2-cue_711
00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.036
not require a mathematical statement,

L2-cue_712
00:50:52.036 --> 00:50:55.086
that the machinery ultimately will be revealed—it’s just a prejudice,

L2-cue_713
00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:57.226
like one of these other prejudices.

L2-cue_714
00:50:57.226 --> 00:51:04.016
It always bothers me that, in spite of all this "local" business, what goes on—in no—matter—

L2-cue_715
00:51:04.016 --> 00:51:07.686
how—tiny a region of space, and no—matter—how—tiny a region of time,

L2-cue_716
00:51:07.686 --> 00:51:11.886
according to the laws as we understand them today—takes a computing machine an infinite

L2-cue_717
00:51:11.886 --> 00:51:13.956
number of logical operations to figure out.

L2-cue_718
00:51:13.956 --> 00:51:18.596
Now, how could all that be going on in that tiny space?

L2-cue_719
00:51:18.596 --> 00:51:22.966
Why should it take an infinite amount of logic to figure out what one stinky,

L2-cue_720
00:51:22.966 --> 00:51:26.826
tiny bit of space-time is going to do?

L2-cue_721
00:51:26.826 --> 00:51:32.776
So I made the hypothesis often that the laws are going to turn out to be, in the end,

L2-cue_722
00:51:32.776 --> 00:51:38.056
simple like the checkerboard, and that all the complexity is from size—but that is

L2-cue_723
00:51:38.056 --> 00:51:41.656
of the same nature as the other speculations that other people make that say, "I like it;

L2-cue_724
00:51:41.656 --> 00:51:47.956
you don’t like it"-it’s not good to be too prejudiced about the thing.

L2-cue_725
00:51:47.956 --> 00:51:56.066
#To summarize, I would use the words of J. H. Jeans, who said that the great architect seems

L2-cue_726
00:51:56.066 --> 00:52:05.286
to be a mathematician—and for you who don’t know mathematics, it’s really quite difficult

L2-cue_727
00:52:05.286 --> 00:52:10.356
to get a real feeling across as to the beauty, the deepest beauty, of nature.

L2-cue_728
00:52:10.356 --> 00:52:13.576
C.P. Snow talked about two cultures.

L2-cue_729
00:52:13.576 --> 00:52:19.856
I really think that those two cultures are people who do, and people who do not—people

L2-cue_730
00:52:19.856 --> 00:52:22.136
who have had, and people who have not had this experience

L2-cue_731
00:52:22.136 --> 00:52:27.856
of understanding mathematics well enough to appreciate nature once.

L2-cue_732
00:52:27.856 --> 00:52:31.986
It’s too bad that it has to be mathematics, and that mathematics for some people is hard.

L2-cue_733
00:52:31.986 --> 00:52:34.296
When one of the [kings] (it’s reputed, I don’t know if it’s true,

L2-cue_734
00:52:34.296 --> 00:52:37.376
that when one of the kings) was trying to learn geometry from Euclid,

L2-cue_735
00:52:37.376 --> 00:52:39.486
he complained that it was difficult.

L2-cue_736
00:52:39.486 --> 00:52:43.366
And Euclid said, "There’s no royal road to geometry."

L2-cue_737
00:52:43.366 --> 00:52:45.456
There’s no royal road.

L2-cue_738
00:52:45.456 --> 00:52:50.286
It’s not the job-we cannot, as people who look at this thing, the physicists,

L2-cue_739
00:52:50.286 --> 00:52:53.466
cannot convert this thing to any other language.

L2-cue_740
00:52:53.466 --> 00:52:58.756
#You have-if you want to discuss nature, to learn about nature, and to appreciate nature,

L2-cue_741
00:52:58.756 --> 00:53:02.756
it’s necessary-to find out the language that she speaks in.

L2-cue_742
00:53:02.756 --> 00:53:05.236
She offers her information only in one form.

L2-cue_743
00:53:05.236 --> 00:53:12.296
We are not so unhumble as to actually demand that she change before we pay any attention.

L2-cue_744
00:53:12.296 --> 00:53:20.906
It seems to me that it’s like: all the intellectual arguments

L2-cue_745
00:53:20.906 --> 00:53:25.736
that you can make would not in any way—or very, very little—communicate

L2-cue_746
00:53:25.736 --> 00:53:32.226
to deaf ears what the experience of music really is; all the intellectual arguments

L2-cue_747
00:53:32.226 --> 00:53:37.296
in the world will not convince those of "the other culture"—the philosophers who try

L2-cue_748
00:53:37.296 --> 00:53:40.626
to teach you by telling you qualitatively about this thing.

L2-cue_749
00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:43.406
[People like] me, who’s trying to describe it to you (but is not getting it across,

L2-cue_750
00:53:43.406 --> 00:53:49.686
because it’s impossible), we’re talking to deaf ears.

L2-cue_751
00:53:49.686 --> 00:53:56.336
It’s perhaps that their horizons are [so] limited, which permit such people to imagine

L2-cue_752
00:53:56.336 --> 00:54:00.756
that the center of the universe of interest is man.

L2-cue_753
00:54:00.756 --> 00:55:33.000
#Thank you.
