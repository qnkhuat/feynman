##Title The Distinction of Past and Future

L5-cue_2
00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:41.566
#Now, it’s obvious to everybody that the phenomena

L5-cue_3
00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:45.366
of the world are evidently irreversible.

L5-cue_4
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:49.646
By that I mean things happen that don’t happen the other way: you drop a cup and it breaks,

L5-cue_5
00:01:49.646 --> 00:01:52.486
and you can sit there a long time waiting for the pieces

L5-cue_6
00:01:52.486 --> 00:01:58.146
to come together and come back into your hand.

L5-cue_7
00:01:58.146 --> 00:02:03.946
If you watch the waves breaking at the sea, you stand there and wait for the great moment

L5-cue_8
00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:09.006
when the foam collects together, rises up out of the sea, and falls back further

L5-cue_9
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:13.016
out from the shore—it would be very pretty.

L5-cue_10
00:02:13.016 --> 00:02:16.906
#As a matter of fact, the demonstration of this in such lectures is usually made

L5-cue_11
00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:20.686
by having a section of moving picture, in which you take a number of phenomena,

L5-cue_12
00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:24.796
and running the thing backwards, and then see all the laughter—the laughter just means this

L5-cue_13
00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:28.546
ain’t gonna happen in the real world.

L5-cue_14
00:02:28.546 --> 00:02:33.416
#But actually, that’s a kind of a weak way to put something which is so obvious and deep

L5-cue_15
00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:35.956
as the difference between the past and the future.

L5-cue_16
00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:39.286
Because even without an experiment,

L5-cue_17
00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:44.606
our very experiences inside are completely different from past and future.

L5-cue_18
00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:47.246
We remember the past; we don’t remember the future.

L5-cue_19
00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:51.956
We have a different kind of awareness about what might happen than we have

L5-cue_20
00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:54.736
of what most likely has happened.

L5-cue_21
00:02:54.736 --> 00:03:01.346
The past and future look completely different psychologically, [as do] the questions

L5-cue_22
00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:08.376
of memory, of apparent freedom of will, in the sense that we feel that we can do something

L5-cue_23
00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:11.796
to affect the future—but none of us, or very few of us,

L5-cue_24
00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:16.926
believe that there’s anything you can do to affect the past.

L5-cue_25
00:03:16.926 --> 00:03:22.996
#Remorse, and regret, and hope are all words

L5-cue_26
00:03:22.996 --> 00:03:27.006
which distinguish perfectly obviously the past and the future.

L5-cue_27
00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:30.856
Now, if the world of nature is made of atoms (and we, too,

L5-cue_28
00:03:30.856 --> 00:03:36.786
are made of atoms that obey physical laws)—this obvious distinction between what happens

L5-cue_29
00:03:36.786 --> 00:03:39.606
in the past and the future, and this obvious irreversibility

L5-cue_30
00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:45.016
of all phenomena—you would think the most likely and obvious interpretation is

L5-cue_31
00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:49.666
that some laws—some of the motion laws of the atoms—are going one way,

L5-cue_32
00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:54.636
that the atom laws are not such that they can go either way, that there’s somewhere

L5-cue_33
00:03:54.636 --> 00:03:59.636
in the works some kind of a principle that ooksels only make wooksels,

L5-cue_34
00:03:59.636 --> 00:04:03.316
and never vice versa, and so the world is turning from ooksely character

L5-cue_35
00:04:03.316 --> 00:04:09.236
to wooksely character all the time, and that this one—way business of the interactions

L5-cue_36
00:04:09.236 --> 00:04:15.186
of things is the thing that makes the whole phenomena of the world seem to go one way.

L5-cue_37
00:04:15.186 --> 00:04:18.146
#Yet we haven’t found it yet.

L5-cue_38
00:04:18.146 --> 00:04:22.906
That is, in all the laws of physics that we’ve found so far, there doesn’t seem

L5-cue_39
00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:26.346
to be any distinction of the past and the future,

L5-cue_40
00:04:26.346 --> 00:04:30.486
that the moving pictures should work the same way going both ways, and the physicist who looks

L5-cue_41
00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:35.076
at it should not laugh—details now to be explained.

L5-cue_42
00:04:35.076 --> 00:04:38.956
#Let us take the law of gravitation as our standard example.

L5-cue_43
00:04:38.956 --> 00:04:46.276
If I have a sun, and a planet that I started off in some direction going around to here,

L5-cue_44
00:04:46.276 --> 00:04:51.146
and then take a moving picture of this—say it gets to here.

L5-cue_45
00:04:51.146 --> 00:04:54.306
Now, take a moving picture of this backwards—take a moving picture of it,

L5-cue_46
00:04:54.306 --> 00:04:57.496
excuse me, and run the movie backwards—and look at it.

L5-cue_47
00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:58.506
What happens?

L5-cue_48
00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:01.876
#The planet goes around the sun in an ellipse.

L5-cue_49
00:05:01.876 --> 00:05:08.926
The speed of—this way, of course: starts here, goes to here, keeps on going around;

L5-cue_50
00:05:08.926 --> 00:05:11.966
goes in an ellipse—the speed of the planet is such that the area swept

L5-cue_51
00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:16.356
out by the radius is always the same in equal time.

L5-cue_52
00:05:16.356 --> 00:05:21.496
[It] just does exactly the way it ought to do, perfectly satisfactory;

L5-cue_53
00:05:21.496 --> 00:05:25.016
it cannot be distinguished from the one going the other way.

L5-cue_54
00:05:25.016 --> 00:05:29.326
So the law of gravitation is of such a kind that it doesn’t make any difference

L5-cue_55
00:05:29.326 --> 00:05:34.266
if you show the phenomenon running—any phenomenon involving just gravitation—running

L5-cue_56
00:05:34.266 --> 00:05:38.826
backwards on a film, it’ll look perfectly satisfactory.

L5-cue_57
00:05:38.826 --> 00:05:43.696
#Put it precisely more this way: if at a given instance the particle moving this way—if all the

L5-cue_58
00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:47.036
particles in a more complicated situation—would have every one

L5-cue_59
00:05:47.036 --> 00:05:51.766
of their speeds reversed suddenly, then the thing will just unwind through all

L5-cue_60
00:05:51.766 --> 00:05:54.066
of the things that it wound up into.

L5-cue_61
00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:57.826
That is, if you have a lot of particles doing this, then you suddenly reverse the speeds,

L5-cue_62
00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:01.406
they will completely undo what they did before.

L5-cue_63
00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:10.356
#Now, this is in the laws of gravitation, which say now the velocity changes as a result

L5-cue_64
00:06:10.356 --> 00:06:15.906
of the forces, and so on; if I reverse the time, the forces are not changed, and so the changes

L5-cue_65
00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:19.876
in velocity are not altered at corresponding distances.

L5-cue_66
00:06:19.876 --> 00:06:24.776
And so each velocity then has its succession of alterations made in exactly the reverse way

L5-cue_67
00:06:24.776 --> 00:06:28.346
that they were made when this went out before, and it’s easy to prove that the law

L5-cue_68
00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.726
of gravitation is time reversible.

L5-cue_69
00:06:31.726 --> 00:06:38.456
#The law of electricity and magnetism: time reversible.

L5-cue_70
00:06:38.456 --> 00:06:43.946
The laws of nuclear interaction: time reversible—as far as we can tell.

L5-cue_71
00:06:43.946 --> 00:06:51.776
The laws of beta decay that we talked about at a previous time: also time reversible;

L5-cue_72
00:06:51.776 --> 00:06:54.136
the difficulty of the experiments of a few months ago,

L5-cue_73
00:06:54.136 --> 00:06:58.226
which indicate that there’s something the matter with—there’s some unknown about—the law,

L5-cue_74
00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:03.886
suggests the possibility that, in fact, it may not be also time reversible, but we shall see.

L5-cue_75
00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:07.536
#But at least the following is true: this beta decay that we’re talking about,

L5-cue_76
00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:13.306
which may not be time reversible (but I don’t know), is a very unimportant phenomenon

L5-cue_77
00:07:13.306 --> 00:07:17.256
for most ordinary circumstances: the possibility of my talking to you does not depend

L5-cue_78
00:07:17.256 --> 00:07:21.966
on that happening; it does depend on chemical interactions; it depends on electrical forces;

L5-cue_79
00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:24.976
it doesn’t actually depend much on nuclear forces at the moment,

L5-cue_80
00:07:24.976 --> 00:07:27.616
but it depends also on gravitation.

L5-cue_81
00:07:27.616 --> 00:07:31.246
#But, I am one-sided: I speak, and the voice goes out into the air

L5-cue_82
00:07:31.246 --> 00:07:34.746
and doesn’t come sucking back into my mouth when I open it.

L5-cue_83
00:07:34.746 --> 00:07:42.126
This irreversibility cannot be hung on the phenomena of beta decay.

L5-cue_84
00:07:42.126 --> 00:07:48.596
In other words, we believe that there are, in the world, most of the ordinary phenomena

L5-cue_85
00:07:48.596 --> 00:07:55.506
which are produced by atomic motions, which are according to laws

L5-cue_86
00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:58.276
which can be completely reversed.

L5-cue_87
00:07:58.276 --> 00:08:02.916
#So we have to look some more to find the explanation.

L5-cue_88
00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:08.236
If we look at this more carefully, and planets moving around the sun more carefully,

L5-cue_89
00:08:08.236 --> 00:08:12.556
you’ll soon find that it isn’t quite right: for example, the earth’s rotation

L5-cue_90
00:08:12.556 --> 00:08:16.486
on its axis is slightly slowing down—that’s due to tidal friction.

L5-cue_91
00:08:16.486 --> 00:08:21.996
You’ll see that friction is something which is obviously irreversible:

L5-cue_92
00:08:21.996 --> 00:08:26.676
if I took a heavy weight [block] on the [wood] floor, here, and pushed it, it would slide

L5-cue_93
00:08:26.676 --> 00:08:31.096
and stop; if I stand and wait for it, it doesn’t suddenly start up

L5-cue_94
00:08:31.096 --> 00:08:33.526
and speed up and come into my hand.

L5-cue_95
00:08:33.526 --> 00:08:36.896
So a frictional effect seems to be irreversible.

L5-cue_96
00:08:36.896 --> 00:08:40.456
#But a frictional effect, as we discussed at another time,

L5-cue_97
00:08:40.456 --> 00:08:46.116
is the result of enormous complexity of the interactions of the block with the wood,

L5-cue_98
00:08:46.116 --> 00:08:47.956
the jiggling of the atoms inside.

L5-cue_99
00:08:47.956 --> 00:08:52.136
That the organized motion of the wood—[I mean,] of the block—is changed into disorganized,

L5-cue_100
00:08:52.136 --> 00:08:55.456
irregular wiggle—waggles of the atoms in the wood.

L5-cue_101
00:08:55.456 --> 00:08:58.726
So that, therefore, we should look at the thing more closely.

L5-cue_102
00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:02.636
#As a matter of fact, we have here the clue to the apparent irreversibility.

L5-cue_103
00:09:02.636 --> 00:09:10.916
I take a simple example of—for example, if we have blue water, say ink, and white water,

L5-cue_104
00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:14.676
that’s water without ink, in a tank, with a little separation,

L5-cue_105
00:09:14.676 --> 00:09:19.236
and pull out the separation very delicately, then it starts out separate—blue

L5-cue_106
00:09:19.236 --> 00:09:21.496
on one side, white on the other side.

L5-cue_107
00:09:21.496 --> 00:09:22.406
#Wait a while.

L5-cue_108
00:09:22.406 --> 00:09:29.586
Gradually the blue mixes up with the white, and after a while the water is "lukeblue": I mean,

L5-cue_109
00:09:29.586 --> 00:09:33.836
it’s sort of 50/50 color, uniformly distributed throughout.

L5-cue_110
00:09:33.836 --> 00:09:36.096
Now if we wait long, for a long time,

L5-cue_111
00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:39.816
and watch this for a long time, it does not by itself separate.

L5-cue_112
00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:43.446
Oh, you can do something—you can get the blue separated again—you can evaporate the water

L5-cue_113
00:09:43.446 --> 00:09:47.876
and condense it somewhere else and collect the blue dye and dissolve it in half the water

L5-cue_114
00:09:47.876 --> 00:09:49.726
and put back this thing, and so on.

L5-cue_115
00:09:49.726 --> 00:09:50.946
#While you’re doing all that, however,

L5-cue_116
00:09:50.946 --> 00:09:55.316
you yourself are causing irreversible phenomena somewhere else.

L5-cue_117
00:09:55.316 --> 00:09:59.836
So by itself it doesn’t go the other way—and that gives us some clue.

L5-cue_118
00:09:59.836 --> 00:10:02.406
#Let’s look at the molecule.

L5-cue_119
00:10:02.406 --> 00:10:09.576
Suppose that we took a moving picture of the water—of the blue and the white water mixing:

L5-cue_120
00:10:09.576 --> 00:10:14.886
it would look funny if we ran it backwards, because we start with uniform water,

L5-cue_121
00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:17.956
and gradually the thing would separate, and would be obviously nutty.

L5-cue_122
00:10:17.956 --> 00:10:22.076
Now, we magnify the picture so that every physicist can watch, atom by atom,

L5-cue_123
00:10:22.076 --> 00:10:25.886
to find out what happened irreversibly—where the laws of balance

L5-cue_124
00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:28.316
of forward and backward broke down.

L5-cue_125
00:10:28.316 --> 00:10:31.526
#You start, and you look at the picture, and you have blue atoms (that’s ridiculous,

L5-cue_126
00:10:31.526 --> 00:10:35.176
but we’ll call it that)—we have atoms of one kind and atoms

L5-cue_127
00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:40.436
of another kind jiggling all the time, in thermal motion, wiggling and bouncing.

L5-cue_128
00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:44.336
If we were to start at the beginning, we would have mostly atoms of one kind on one side,

L5-cue_129
00:10:44.336 --> 00:10:47.346
and atoms of the other kind on the other side.

L5-cue_130
00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:50.816
#Now, these atoms are jiggling around—that’s too small a box;

L5-cue_131
00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:56.516
you need more to get this effect—billions and billions of these atoms.

L5-cue_132
00:10:56.516 --> 00:11:02.376
Now, these atoms are jiggling around—I just put one more but I’m getting tired of making these.

L5-cue_133
00:11:02.376 --> 00:11:09.086
These atoms are jiggling around, and if we start all on one side and all on the other, we see,

L5-cue_134
00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:12.146
of course, that in their perpetual irregular motions,

L5-cue_135
00:11:12.146 --> 00:11:17.776
they’ll get mixed up—and that’s why it gets to be more or less uniformly blue.

L5-cue_136
00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:20.626
But let’s watch any one collision.

L5-cue_137
00:11:20.626 --> 00:11:23.576
#Here’s a particular collision selected from that picture:

L5-cue_138
00:11:23.576 --> 00:11:26.986
here’s this molecule moving this way, and this one moving this way.

L5-cue_139
00:11:26.986 --> 00:11:31.206
They come together, say, in the moving picture, and they bounce off this way.

L5-cue_140
00:11:31.206 --> 00:11:34.046
Now you run that section of the film backwards, and you find a pair

L5-cue_141
00:11:34.046 --> 00:11:38.996
of molecules moving this way, bouncing off that way, and the physicist looks with his keen eye

L5-cue_142
00:11:38.996 --> 00:11:42.306
and measures everything and says, "That’s all right; that’s according to the laws of physics:

L5-cue_143
00:11:42.306 --> 00:11:44.976
if two molecules came this way, they would bounce that way,

L5-cue_144
00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:46.946
and if they came that way, they would bounce this way.

L5-cue_145
00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:50.796
It’s reversible—the laws of molecular collision are reversible."

L5-cue_146
00:11:50.796 --> 00:11:53.966
#If you watch too carefully, you can’t understand it at all,

L5-cue_147
00:11:53.966 --> 00:11:57.486
because every one of the collisions is absolutely reversible,

L5-cue_148
00:11:57.486 --> 00:12:02.496
and yet the whole moving picture shows something absurd,

L5-cue_149
00:12:02.496 --> 00:12:06.956
which is that the molecules start—in the reverse picture, the molecules start

L5-cue_150
00:12:06.956 --> 00:12:13.386
in this condition—blue, white, blue, white, and blue, white, and so on, all mixed up,

L5-cue_151
00:12:13.386 --> 00:12:17.276
and yet as time goes on, through all the collisions, the blue separates

L5-cue_152
00:12:17.276 --> 00:12:20.996
from the white—they can’t do that!

L5-cue_153
00:12:20.996 --> 00:12:23.726
#That’s not natural, that the accidents of life will be

L5-cue_154
00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:26.026
such that the blues will separate themselves from the whites,

L5-cue_155
00:12:26.026 --> 00:12:30.426
yet if you watch it move—this reverse movie—very carefully, every collision is okay.

L5-cue_156
00:12:30.426 --> 00:12:34.446
Well, you see that’s all there is to it, that the irreversibility is caused

L5-cue_157
00:12:34.446 --> 00:12:40.706
by the general accidents of life: that if you start with a thing that’s separated like this,

L5-cue_158
00:12:40.706 --> 00:12:44.676
and just make irregular changes, it gets more uniform,

L5-cue_159
00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:46.856
but if you start with something that’s uniform,

L5-cue_160
00:12:46.856 --> 00:12:50.876
and make irregular changes, it doesn’t get separated.

L5-cue_161
00:12:50.876 --> 00:12:55.596
It could get separated; it’s not against the laws of physics that these things bounce

L5-cue_162
00:12:55.596 --> 00:13:00.406
around so that they separate; it’s just unlikely.

L5-cue_163
00:13:00.406 --> 00:13:06.056
It just—it would never happen in a million years!—and that’s the answer.

L5-cue_164
00:13:06.056 --> 00:13:11.456
#The things are irreversible only in the sense that going one way is likely to go,

L5-cue_165
00:13:11.456 --> 00:13:15.706
but going the other way, although is possible and is according to the laws of physics,

L5-cue_166
00:13:15.706 --> 00:13:17.756
wouldn’t happen in a million years.

L5-cue_167
00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:21.286
It’s just ridiculous to expect that if you sit there long enough,

L5-cue_168
00:13:21.286 --> 00:13:26.086
the jiggling of the atoms will separate a mixture, a uniform mixture,

L5-cue_169
00:13:26.086 --> 00:13:31.356
of ink and water into ink on one side, and water on the other.

L5-cue_170
00:13:31.356 --> 00:13:37.276
#Now, if I had put a box around here so that this was all the molecules that there were,

L5-cue_171
00:13:37.276 --> 00:13:42.046
as time went on they would get mixed up.

L5-cue_172
00:13:42.046 --> 00:13:45.996
But if you’re patient, I think you could believe that in the perpetual, irregular collisions

L5-cue_173
00:13:45.996 --> 00:13:52.426
of these molecules, after some time (not necessarily a million years, maybe only a year),

L5-cue_174
00:13:52.426 --> 00:13:56.886
if you keep watching, accidentally they get back more or less like this—in the sense, at least;

L5-cue_175
00:13:56.886 --> 00:14:01.456
they get back far enough to say that if I drew a line through, all the whites on one side

L5-cue_176
00:14:01.456 --> 00:14:05.136
and all the blues on the other—it’s not impossible.

L5-cue_177
00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:11.416
However, the actual objects with which we work have not only four or five blues and whites,

L5-cue_178
00:14:11.416 --> 00:14:16.946
but they have four or five million, million, million, million atoms.

L5-cue_179
00:14:16.946 --> 00:14:20.646
And it’s just not likely that four or five million, million, million,

L5-cue_180
00:14:20.646 --> 00:14:23.596
million are all going to get separated like this.

L5-cue_181
00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:27.616
#So the apparent irreversibly of nature does not come from the irreversibility

L5-cue_182
00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:32.076
of the fundamental physical laws; it comes from the characteristic that if we start

L5-cue_183
00:14:32.076 --> 00:14:34.886
with an ordered system and have the irregularities

L5-cue_184
00:14:34.886 --> 00:14:41.276
of nature bouncing, then the thing goes one way.

L5-cue_185
00:14:41.276 --> 00:14:47.646
#Therefore, the next question is how did it get ordered in the first place?

L5-cue_186
00:14:47.646 --> 00:14:50.106
That is to say, why is it possible to start with the order?

L5-cue_187
00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:52.566
Because, you see, the difficulty is that we start with an ordered thing;

L5-cue_188
00:14:52.566 --> 00:14:54.296
we don’t end with an ordered thing.

L5-cue_189
00:14:54.296 --> 00:14:57.886
One of the rules of the world is that the conditions at the beginning—I mean,

L5-cue_190
00:14:57.886 --> 00:15:01.006
that the thing goes from an ordered condition to a disordered [one].

L5-cue_191
00:15:01.006 --> 00:15:05.646
#(Incidentally, this word order, and disorder, is another one of those terms of physics

L5-cue_192
00:15:05.646 --> 00:15:11.646
which aren’t exactly the same as it is in ordinary life: the order need not be interesting

L5-cue_193
00:15:11.646 --> 00:15:16.946
to you human beings; it’s just a question that there’s a definite situation—they’re all

L5-cue_194
00:15:16.946 --> 00:15:21.556
on one side and all on the other, or they’re mixed up—that’s the order to disorder.

L5-cue_195
00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:26.396
Maybe you like it better mixed up, but that’s not more ordered, anyhow.)

L5-cue_196
00:15:26.396 --> 00:15:34.696
#Now...

L5-cue_197
00:15:34.696 --> 00:15:39.546
...the question is, then, how does the thing in the first place get ordered, and why,

L5-cue_198
00:15:39.546 --> 00:15:43.906
when we look at any ordinary situation which is only partly ordered,

L5-cue_199
00:15:43.906 --> 00:15:47.846
we can conclude that it probably came from more ordered.

L5-cue_200
00:15:47.846 --> 00:15:52.456
If I look at a tank of water in which it’s very dark blue on this side,

L5-cue_201
00:15:52.456 --> 00:15:57.876
and very clear white water here, and sort of bluish water in between,

L5-cue_202
00:15:57.876 --> 00:16:05.516
and I know that that thing has been left alone for 20, 30 minutes,

L5-cue_203
00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:12.006
then I will guess that it got this way because it was bluer before—for instance,

L5-cue_204
00:16:12.006 --> 00:16:16.996
if I find—I mean, that the separation was more complete in the past.

L5-cue_205
00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:24.906
If I find, for example, two objects—well, this is as good an example as any.

L5-cue_206
00:16:24.906 --> 00:16:28.296
If I wait longer, then the blue and white would get more intermixed.

L5-cue_207
00:16:28.296 --> 00:16:31.456
If I know that this thing has been left alone for a sufficiently long time,

L5-cue_208
00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:35.276
I can conclude something about the past condition: the fact that it’s smooth

L5-cue_209
00:16:35.276 --> 00:16:38.186
in here could only arise because it was much "better"

L5-cue_210
00:16:38.186 --> 00:16:41.436
in the past—much more satisfactorily separated—because

L5-cue_211
00:16:41.436 --> 00:16:44.276
if it weren’t more satisfactorily separated in the past,

L5-cue_212
00:16:44.276 --> 00:16:48.776
in the time since then it would have gotten more mixed up than it is.

L5-cue_213
00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:55.846
#It is therefore possible to tell from the present something about the past,

L5-cue_214
00:16:55.846 --> 00:17:00.026
although physicists really do not do this much: physicists usually like to think

L5-cue_215
00:17:00.026 --> 00:17:03.696
that all you have to do is say, "These are the conditions, and what happens next?"

L5-cue_216
00:17:03.696 --> 00:17:08.366
But all our sister sciences have a completely different problem; in fact, all the other things

L5-cue_217
00:17:08.366 --> 00:17:13.496
that are studied—history, geology, and astronomical history—all have a problem

L5-cue_218
00:17:13.496 --> 00:17:16.536
of this kind: I find they’re able to make predictions

L5-cue_219
00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.896
of a completely different type than a physicist.

L5-cue_220
00:17:18.896 --> 00:17:22.286
#A physicist says, "In this condition, I’ll tell you what’ll happen next."

L5-cue_221
00:17:22.286 --> 00:17:26.416
But a geologist will say something like this: "I have dug in the ground,

L5-cue_222
00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:29.296
and I’ve found certain kinds of bones.

L5-cue_223
00:17:29.296 --> 00:17:32.346
I predict that if you dig in the ground you’ll find a similar kind of bone."

L5-cue_224
00:17:32.346 --> 00:17:40.146
A historian, although he talks about the past, can do it by talking about the future:

L5-cue_225
00:17:40.146 --> 00:17:50.346
when he says, "Napoleon exists," or "Napoleon was"—or that the French Revolution was in 1783,

L5-cue_226
00:17:50.346 --> 00:17:54.206
he means that if you look in another book about this French Revolution,

L5-cue_227
00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:59.736
you’ll find that same date—1789, maybe.

L5-cue_228
00:17:59.736 --> 00:18:10.286
(That’s pretty accurate for a physicist—to have the third decimal, to three figures.)

L5-cue_229
00:18:10.286 --> 00:18:14.896
#Now, the thing that he says is, he makes a kind of prediction

L5-cue_230
00:18:14.896 --> 00:18:20.016
about something he has never looked at before—documents that have still to be found.

L5-cue_231
00:18:20.016 --> 00:18:22.876
He predicts that the documents, if there’s something written about Napoleon,

L5-cue_232
00:18:22.876 --> 00:18:25.846
will coincide with what is written in the other document.

L5-cue_233
00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:28.436
The question is how that’s possible.

L5-cue_234
00:18:28.436 --> 00:18:32.156
#The only way that that’s possible is to suggest that the past

L5-cue_235
00:18:32.156 --> 00:18:36.826
of the world was more organized in this sense than the present.

L5-cue_236
00:18:36.826 --> 00:18:43.666
Some people have proposed at one time (the physicists only have proposed this,

L5-cue_237
00:18:43.666 --> 00:18:47.896
some of the physicists) that the way it got ordered was this:

L5-cue_238
00:18:47.896 --> 00:18:51.456
that the whole universe is just irregular motions like this,

L5-cue_239
00:18:51.456 --> 00:18:53.996
and that if you see-if you wait long enough with five atoms,

L5-cue_240
00:18:53.996 --> 00:18:56.796
of course it can get separated accidentally.

L5-cue_241
00:18:56.796 --> 00:19:00.596
#All that has happened is that in the world has been going on and going on and going on

L5-cue_242
00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:03.906
and going on and going on, and it fluctuated—that’s what this is called,

L5-cue_243
00:19:03.906 --> 00:19:07.856
when it gets a little bit out of ordinary—it fluctuated,

L5-cue_244
00:19:07.856 --> 00:19:11.836
and now we’re watching the fluctuation undo itself again.

L5-cue_245
00:19:11.836 --> 00:19:16.506
#How do we know that isn’t the case?

L5-cue_246
00:19:16.506 --> 00:19:18.466
You say, "Well, how long you would have to wait?"

L5-cue_247
00:19:18.466 --> 00:19:23.016
I know, but if it didn’t fluctuate far enough to be able to produce evolution,

L5-cue_248
00:19:23.016 --> 00:19:26.516
to be able to produce an intelligent person, we wouldn’t have noticed it—so we had

L5-cue_249
00:19:26.516 --> 00:19:28.916
to keep waiting until we were alive to notice it—so we have

L5-cue_250
00:19:28.916 --> 00:19:31.526
to have at least that big a fluctuation.

L5-cue_251
00:19:31.526 --> 00:19:34.396
#But this thing-this is incorrect, I believe;

L5-cue_252
00:19:34.396 --> 00:19:37.526
I think that’s a ridiculous theory for the following reason.

L5-cue_253
00:19:37.526 --> 00:19:44.916
That if the world were much bigger, and there were atoms all over the place,

L5-cue_254
00:19:44.916 --> 00:19:52.336
and they started from a completely mixed-up condition—all over—and I happen only to look

L5-cue_255
00:19:52.336 --> 00:19:59.956
at the atoms here, and I find that the atoms here are separated, I have no way to conclude

L5-cue_256
00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:02.646
that the atoms anywhere else are separated.

L5-cue_257
00:20:02.646 --> 00:20:07.496
#In fact, if the thing were a fluctuation, and I noticed something odd, the most likely way

L5-cue_258
00:20:07.496 --> 00:20:10.626
that it got there is if there’s nothing odd anywhere else.

L5-cue_259
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:14.476
That is, I have to "borrow odds," so to speak, to get this lopsided,

L5-cue_260
00:20:14.476 --> 00:20:17.356
and there’s no use on borrowing too much.

L5-cue_261
00:20:17.356 --> 00:20:22.476
It’s much more likely of all the possible ways in which these six atoms can be on one side

L5-cue_262
00:20:22.476 --> 00:20:26.576
and these seven on the other side of all the possibilities, the most likely condition

L5-cue_263
00:20:26.576 --> 00:20:29.796
of the rest of the world is mixed up.

L5-cue_264
00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:35.686
#Therefore, an astronomer, looking at a star that he’s never—although, when we look at the stars

L5-cue_265
00:20:35.686 --> 00:20:39.906
and we look at the world, we see it’s ordered, there could be a fluctuation,

L5-cue_266
00:20:39.906 --> 00:20:43.466
the prediction would be that if we’d look at a place that we haven’t looked at before,

L5-cue_267
00:20:43.466 --> 00:20:48.286
it’ll be disordered, and a mess—that the separation of the matter into stars

L5-cue_268
00:20:48.286 --> 00:20:52.736
which are hot, and space which is cold, which we’ve seen—although,

L5-cue_269
00:20:52.736 --> 00:20:57.096
if you say it could be a fluctuation, then in places that we haven’t looked we would expect

L5-cue_270
00:20:57.096 --> 00:21:03.696
that the stars are not separated from the space, since every time we make a prediction

L5-cue_271
00:21:03.696 --> 00:21:06.006
that in a place that we haven’t looked, we’ll see the same statement

L5-cue_272
00:21:06.006 --> 00:21:10.366
about Napoleon—we’ll see stars in a similar condition—we’ll see bones

L5-cue_273
00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:12.296
like the bones that we’ve seen before.

L5-cue_274
00:21:12.296 --> 00:21:16.766
#The success of all those sciences indicate that the world did not come from a fluctuation

L5-cue_275
00:21:16.766 --> 00:21:19.706
but came from a condition which was more separated,

L5-cue_276
00:21:19.706 --> 00:21:23.016
more organized in the past than at the present time.

L5-cue_277
00:21:23.016 --> 00:21:29.416
#Therefore, I think it’s necessary that to add to the physical laws the hypothesis

L5-cue_278
00:21:29.416 --> 00:21:32.386
that in the past the universe was more ordered,

L5-cue_279
00:21:32.386 --> 00:21:38.786
in a technical sense—less mixed up—than it is today,

L5-cue_280
00:21:38.786 --> 00:21:43.336
that this statement is the added statement that’s needed to make sense,

L5-cue_281
00:21:43.336 --> 00:21:46.466
and to make an understanding of the irreversibility.

L5-cue_282
00:21:46.466 --> 00:21:49.016
That statement, of course, is itself lopsided in time.

L5-cue_283
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:53.076
It says something about the past is different than the future, but it comes outside

L5-cue_284
00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:58.686
of the province of what we ordinarily call physical laws, because we try, today,

L5-cue_285
00:21:58.686 --> 00:22:04.226
to distinguish (maybe someday we won’t do that, but we do, today, distinguish) between the laws

L5-cue_286
00:22:04.226 --> 00:22:07.896
which tell how something moves if you start it in a certain way, and those statements

L5-cue_287
00:22:07.896 --> 00:22:12.166
about how the universe got the way it gets, or has been, what it was in the past,

L5-cue_288
00:22:12.166 --> 00:22:16.856
and what it’s going to get to be—no, excuse me: the statement of the physical laws

L5-cue_289
00:22:16.856 --> 00:22:22.276
which govern the rules by which the universe develops, and the law which states the condition

L5-cue_290
00:22:22.276 --> 00:22:26.046
that the world was in the past, that’s considered to be astronomical history.

L5-cue_291
00:22:26.046 --> 00:22:29.786
Perhaps someday that will also be a part of physical law.

L5-cue_292
00:22:29.786 --> 00:22:36.816
#Now, there are a number of interesting features of irreversibility

L5-cue_293
00:22:36.816 --> 00:22:39.906
that I think I would like to illustrate.

L5-cue_294
00:22:39.906 --> 00:22:46.596
One of them is to see how exactly an irreversible machine really works.

L5-cue_295
00:22:46.596 --> 00:22:52.336
Suppose that we built something that we know ought to work only one way.

L5-cue_296
00:22:52.336 --> 00:22:57.316
What I’m going to build is a wheel with a ratchet on it.

L5-cue_297
00:22:57.316 --> 00:23:03.886
A ratchet means just this—that we have a notched wheel with steps.

L5-cue_298
00:23:03.886 --> 00:23:09.436
(I’ve drawn the wrong way for what I’m used to thinking about it.

L5-cue_299
00:23:09.436 --> 00:23:14.406
No, I had it right, because this way there’s another notch—a sawtooth wheel like this,

L5-cue_300
00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:20.616
with sharp up notches and relatively slow down notches, all the way around.)

L5-cue_301
00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:30.296
#And then—this is a wheel on a shaft—then on this thing there’s a little piece of pawl,

L5-cue_302
00:23:30.296 --> 00:23:34.846
a thing called a pawl, which is on a pivot here, and which is held down by a spring.

L5-cue_303
00:23:34.846 --> 00:23:39.526
(It gets in the way of the wheel, but that’s a small technical difficulty:

L5-cue_304
00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:44.796
this is two-dimensional, and actually it’s set a little bit below.)

L5-cue_305
00:23:44.796 --> 00:23:48.006
Now, this wheel can only turn one way.

L5-cue_306
00:23:48.006 --> 00:23:53.196
If you try to turn it this way, then these straight—edged parts of the teeth get jammed

L5-cue_307
00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:56.856
against the pawl, and it doesn’t go—whereas if you turn it the other way,

L5-cue_308
00:23:56.856 --> 00:24:00.126
it would just go right over the thing and—snap, snap, snap, pop, pop, pop—ping.

L5-cue_309
00:24:00.126 --> 00:24:03.196
#[This is why] they use them in clocks, so when you wind watches, they have this kind

L5-cue_310
00:24:03.196 --> 00:24:06.436
of a thing inside so that you can only wind it one way,

L5-cue_311
00:24:06.436 --> 00:24:08.776
and after you’ve wound it, it holds a spring.

L5-cue_312
00:24:08.776 --> 00:24:12.166
#Now, we want to discuss—you see, it’s completely irreversible in the sense

L5-cue_313
00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:16.036
that the wheel can only turn one way.

L5-cue_314
00:24:16.036 --> 00:24:20.956
Now, this irreversible machine—this wheel that can only turn one way—has been imagined

L5-cue_315
00:24:20.956 --> 00:24:24.826
that you could use it for a very useful thing, say, a very interesting thing:

L5-cue_316
00:24:24.826 --> 00:24:29.236
because of molecular irregularities—because of molecular motion,

L5-cue_317
00:24:29.236 --> 00:24:32.596
perpetual motion—there’s a perpetual motion of molecules.

L5-cue_318
00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.196
#And if you build a very delicate instrument, it will always jiggle,

L5-cue_319
00:24:35.196 --> 00:24:39.626
because it’s being bombarded irregularly by the air molecules in the neighborhood.

L5-cue_320
00:24:39.626 --> 00:24:43.226
So, that’s very clever; we’ll connect this with a shaft, which is hard to illustrate

L5-cue_321
00:24:43.226 --> 00:24:46.356
in three dimensions; it goes way out here.

L5-cue_322
00:24:46.356 --> 00:24:48.596
You connect this to it with a shaft, with a vane,

L5-cue_323
00:24:48.596 --> 00:24:51.016
with a set—the wheel has four vanes (actually,

L5-cue_324
00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:54.216
my angles and things have gotten a little bit mixed up:

L5-cue_325
00:24:54.216 --> 00:24:58.286
look down on the shaft—this thing’s got four vanes like this.)

L5-cue_326
00:24:58.286 --> 00:25:02.886
Those are bombarded—they’re in a box of gas here, and they’re bombarded all the time

L5-cue_327
00:25:02.886 --> 00:25:05.876
by the molecules, irregularly, so the thing is pushed sometimes one way,

L5-cue_328
00:25:05.876 --> 00:25:07.756
sometimes the other way.

L5-cue_329
00:25:07.756 --> 00:25:10.336
#[Now,] when it’s pushed one way, this thing gets jammed,

L5-cue_330
00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:12.956
but when it’s pushed the other way, it goes around.

L5-cue_331
00:25:12.956 --> 00:25:17.026
So we find the wheel perpetually going around, and we have a kind of perpetual motion.

L5-cue_332
00:25:17.026 --> 00:25:24.386
That’s because this wheel is irreversible—but actually, we have to look into the details.

L5-cue_333
00:25:24.386 --> 00:25:28.856
The way this works is that when the wheel goes one way, it lifts the pawl up

L5-cue_334
00:25:28.856 --> 00:25:35.446
and then the pawl snaps down against the next tooth—and it will bounce,

L5-cue_335
00:25:35.446 --> 00:25:39.586
if it’s perfectly elastic; it will go bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, all the time.

L5-cue_336
00:25:39.586 --> 00:25:44.616
#The wheel could just go down around the other way when the pawl accidentally bounces up!

L5-cue_337
00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:49.816
This will not work unless it’s true that when the pawl comes down it sticks, or stops,

L5-cue_338
00:25:49.816 --> 00:25:52.956
or bounces, and cuts out: if it bounces and cuts out,

L5-cue_339
00:25:52.956 --> 00:25:56.336
there must be what we call damping, or friction, again.

L5-cue_340
00:25:56.336 --> 00:25:58.006
And in the falling down and bouncing

L5-cue_341
00:25:58.006 --> 00:26:00.196
and stopping (which is the only way this will work one way),

L5-cue_342
00:26:00.196 --> 00:26:04.076
heat is generated by the friction: this part of the wheel,

L5-cue_343
00:26:04.076 --> 00:26:07.026
over here, will get hotter and hotter.

L5-cue_344
00:26:07.026 --> 00:26:11.266
#However, when it begins to get quite warm, something else happens:

L5-cue_345
00:26:11.266 --> 00:26:14.986
just as there’s Brownian motion, or irregular motions in the gas here; so,

L5-cue_346
00:26:14.986 --> 00:26:17.076
whatever this is made out of—the parts that this is made

L5-cue_347
00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:19.966
out of—are getting hotter, and are becoming more irregular.

L5-cue_348
00:26:19.966 --> 00:26:23.466
So a time comes when this is hot enough, that the pawl is simply jiggling

L5-cue_349
00:26:23.466 --> 00:26:26.966
because of the molecular motions of the things on the inside.

L5-cue_350
00:26:26.966 --> 00:26:30.526
And so it bounces up and down on here because of molecular motion—the same thing

L5-cue_351
00:26:30.526 --> 00:26:34.256
that was making this vane turn around—and in bouncing up and down on here,

L5-cue_352
00:26:34.256 --> 00:26:40.166
it is up as much as it is down; when it is up as much as it is down, a tooth can go either way.

L5-cue_353
00:26:40.166 --> 00:26:44.846
#As a matter of fact, the thing will be driven backwards: if this one was hot

L5-cue_354
00:26:44.846 --> 00:26:46.496
and this one was cold, the wheel

L5-cue_355
00:26:46.496 --> 00:26:51.826
that you thought would go only one way would go the other way, because: in the terrible bouncing

L5-cue_356
00:26:51.826 --> 00:26:55.126
up and down on this wheel, every time it comes down it comes

L5-cue_357
00:26:55.126 --> 00:26:59.986
down on an incline plane—and so it pushes the wheel this way.

L5-cue_358
00:26:59.986 --> 00:27:03.006
Then it bounces up again, comes down another incline plane,

L5-cue_359
00:27:03.006 --> 00:27:08.726
and so on-and so if this side is hotter than this side, it’ll go around this way.

L5-cue_360
00:27:08.726 --> 00:27:12.206
#What’s it got to do with the temperature of this side—suppose they didn’t have that at all?

L5-cue_361
00:27:12.206 --> 00:27:16.446
Oh: then, if it’s pushed forward by falling on an incline plane,

L5-cue_362
00:27:16.446 --> 00:27:17.686
the next thing that will happen is,

L5-cue_363
00:27:17.686 --> 00:27:22.226
it will bounce against that tooth, and the wheel will bounce back.

L5-cue_364
00:27:22.226 --> 00:27:25.726
But in order to prevent the wheel from bouncing back, we put a damper on it:

L5-cue_365
00:27:25.726 --> 00:27:29.206
we put vanes in the air, so that it can’t go.

L5-cue_366
00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:31.576
Then it can only- it will go one way, but the wrong way,

L5-cue_367
00:27:31.576 --> 00:27:36.716
and so it turns out that no matter how you design it, a wheel like this will go the one way

L5-cue_368
00:27:36.716 --> 00:27:41.106
if this side is hotter, and go the other way if this side is hotter.

L5-cue_369
00:27:41.106 --> 00:27:44.516
#But after there’s a heat exchange between the two, and everything has calmed down,

L5-cue_370
00:27:44.516 --> 00:27:49.376
it will neither go one way or the other—that’s the technical way in which the phenomena

L5-cue_371
00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:54.756
of nature will go one way as long as they’re out of equilibrium, as long as one side is quieter

L5-cue_372
00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:58.936
than the other, or one side is bluer than the other.

L5-cue_373
00:27:58.936 --> 00:28:03.546
The conservation of energy would let us think that we have as much energy

L5-cue_374
00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:07.126
as we want—nature never loses or gains energy.

L5-cue_375
00:28:07.126 --> 00:28:11.656
Yet the energy of the sea, for example—the thermal motion of all the atoms

L5-cue_376
00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:18.486
in the sea—is practically unavailable to us: in order to get that energy organized—herded, used,

L5-cue_377
00:28:18.486 --> 00:28:21.406
make it useful, make it available for use—we have

L5-cue_378
00:28:21.406 --> 00:28:24.116
to have some place that’s at a different temperature.

L5-cue_379
00:28:24.116 --> 00:28:28.326
We have to use a difference in temperature, or else we’ll find

L5-cue_380
00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:31.806
that although the energy is there, we cannot make use of it.

L5-cue_381
00:28:31.806 --> 00:28:36.886
There’s a great difference between energy and availability of energy.

L5-cue_382
00:28:36.886 --> 00:28:42.886
#The energy of the sea, for example, is a large amount, but it’s not available to us.

L5-cue_383
00:28:42.886 --> 00:28:48.076
I think I can give an analogy, or give some idea of what the difficulty is, this way:

L5-cue_384
00:28:48.076 --> 00:28:51.986
the conservation of energy means that the total energy in the world is kept the same—but

L5-cue_385
00:28:51.986 --> 00:28:56.016
in the irregular jiggling, that energy can be spread about so uniformly

L5-cue_386
00:28:56.016 --> 00:29:00.256
that there’s no (in certain circumstances) there’s no way to make more go one way

L5-cue_387
00:29:00.256 --> 00:29:03.066
than the other; there’s no way to control it anymore.

L5-cue_388
00:29:03.066 --> 00:29:08.186
I don’t know if you’ve ever had this experience, but I have had, going to the beach with several,

L5-cue_389
00:29:08.186 --> 00:29:10.726
many towels, and so on, and sitting happily

L5-cue_390
00:29:10.726 --> 00:29:14.916
on the beach-and having a tremendous downpour suddenly come, picking up the towels as quickly

L5-cue_391
00:29:14.916 --> 00:29:17.796
as you can, and running into the bathhouse.

L5-cue_392
00:29:17.796 --> 00:29:19.556
Then you start to dry yourself, and you find

L5-cue_393
00:29:19.556 --> 00:29:22.706
that this towel is a little wet, but it’s drier than you are.

L5-cue_394
00:29:22.706 --> 00:29:25.976
You keep drying this one; then you find that one’s too wet—it’s wetting you as much

L5-cue_395
00:29:25.976 --> 00:29:29.716
as it’s drying you, and you try another one, and pretty soon you discover a horrible thing:

L5-cue_396
00:29:29.716 --> 00:29:32.276
all the towels are damp, and so are you.

L5-cue_397
00:29:32.276 --> 00:29:37.316
And as you keep picking them up and putting them down and rearranging them, and there’s no way

L5-cue_398
00:29:37.316 --> 00:29:42.316
to get any drier, no matter how many towels—even though you have many towels—because there’s no

L5-cue_399
00:29:42.316 --> 00:29:46.636
difference in some sense between the wetness of the towel and the wetness of yourself.

L5-cue_400
00:29:46.636 --> 00:29:55.236
I could invent a kind of a quantity which I could call "ease of removing water," or—yes,

L5-cue_401
00:29:55.236 --> 00:30:00.766
let’s call it "ease of removing water": the towel has the same "ease

L5-cue_402
00:30:00.766 --> 00:30:03.886
of removing water" from it as you have.

L5-cue_403
00:30:03.886 --> 00:30:08.506
And so when you touch the towel to you, as much water comes off from the towel to you,

L5-cue_404
00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.956
as it does from you to the towel.

L5-cue_405
00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:13.716
It doesn’t mean there’s the same amount of water in the towel as there is

L5-cue_406
00:30:13.716 --> 00:30:16.756
on you-a big towel will have more water in it

L5-cue_407
00:30:16.756 --> 00:30:21.456
than a little towel—but they have the same dampness.

L5-cue_408
00:30:21.456 --> 00:30:28.436
#When things get to the same dampness, then there’s nothing you can do any longer.

L5-cue_409
00:30:28.436 --> 00:30:33.836
Now, the water is like the energy, because the total amount of water isn’t changing.

L5-cue_410
00:30:33.836 --> 00:30:37.886
But if we had a world which was limited—see, if the bathhouse door is open,

L5-cue_411
00:30:37.886 --> 00:30:39.706
and you can run into the sun and get dried out,

L5-cue_412
00:30:39.706 --> 00:30:42.216
or find another towel, you see, okay, that’s different.

L5-cue_413
00:30:42.216 --> 00:30:43.876
Then you got saved.

L5-cue_414
00:30:43.876 --> 00:30:46.276
But if you have everything closed, and you can’t get away

L5-cue_415
00:30:46.276 --> 00:30:50.396
from these towels—you can’t get a new towel—so if you imagine this part of the world

L5-cue_416
00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:55.696
that was closed, wait long enough, and, in the accidents of the world, the energy,

L5-cue_417
00:30:55.696 --> 00:31:00.386
like the water, will be distributed all over, all of the parts, evenly.

L5-cue_418
00:31:00.386 --> 00:31:04.986
#There’s nothing left of one—wayness; there’s nothing left of the real interest

L5-cue_419
00:31:04.986 --> 00:31:07.046
of the world as we experience it.

L5-cue_420
00:31:07.046 --> 00:31:11.476
Thus, in this situation here, which is a limited one, in which nothing else is supposed

L5-cue_421
00:31:11.476 --> 00:31:15.136
to be involved, the temperatures gradually become equal on both sides,

L5-cue_422
00:31:15.136 --> 00:31:18.586
and the wheel doesn’t go around either one way or the other.

L5-cue_423
00:31:18.586 --> 00:31:26.896
In the same way, the situation is, if you leave a system long enough,

L5-cue_424
00:31:26.896 --> 00:31:29.696
it gets the energy thoroughly mixed up in it,

L5-cue_425
00:31:29.696 --> 00:31:32.776
and no more energy is really available to do anything.

L5-cue_426
00:31:32.776 --> 00:31:37.446
#Incidentally, the thing that corresponds to the dampness is called the temperature.

L5-cue_427
00:31:37.446 --> 00:31:41.526
And although when I say two things [are] at the same temperature when things get balanced,

L5-cue_428
00:31:41.526 --> 00:31:45.086
it doesn’t mean they have the same energy in them; it just means it’s just as easy

L5-cue_429
00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:47.276
to pick energy off of one, as to pick it off the other.

L5-cue_430
00:31:47.276 --> 00:31:51.946
So if you put them next to each other, nothing apparently happens: they pass energy back

L5-cue_431
00:31:51.946 --> 00:31:54.686
and forth between them; the net result is nothing.

L5-cue_432
00:31:54.686 --> 00:31:57.596
When things have become all at the same temperature,

L5-cue_433
00:31:57.596 --> 00:32:02.476
then there’s no more energy available to do anything.

L5-cue_434
00:32:02.476 --> 00:32:06.556
#The principle of irreversibility is that if things are at a different temperature

L5-cue_435
00:32:06.556 --> 00:32:10.066
and are left to themselves, as time goes on, they become more and more

L5-cue_436
00:32:10.066 --> 00:32:15.366
at the same temperature, and the availability of energy is perpetually decreasing.

L5-cue_437
00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:19.586
This is another name for what’s called the entropy law,

L5-cue_438
00:32:19.586 --> 00:32:21.226
which says entropy is always increasing.

L5-cue_439
00:32:21.226 --> 00:32:23.946
#But never mind the words; to state it the other way,

L5-cue_440
00:32:23.946 --> 00:32:26.886
the availability of energy is always decreasing.

L5-cue_441
00:32:26.886 --> 00:32:33.126
That’s a characteristic of the world, in the sense that it’s due to the chaos

L5-cue_442
00:32:33.126 --> 00:32:38.516
of molecular irregular motions: things of different temperature, left to themselves,

L5-cue_443
00:32:38.516 --> 00:32:43.816
tend to become of the same temperature, but if you have two things at the same temperature,

L5-cue_444
00:32:43.816 --> 00:32:48.806
like water on an ordinary stove without a fire,

L5-cue_445
00:32:48.806 --> 00:32:51.016
the water isn’t going to freeze and the stove get hot.

L5-cue_446
00:32:51.016 --> 00:32:53.806
(But if you have a hot stove with ice, it goes the other way.)

L5-cue_447
00:32:53.806 --> 00:33:00.246
The one-wayness is always the loss of the availability of energy.

L5-cue_448
00:33:00.246 --> 00:33:06.626
#Well, that’s all I want to say on the subject,

L5-cue_449
00:33:06.626 --> 00:33:12.666
but I want to make a few remarks about some characteristics.

L5-cue_450
00:33:12.666 --> 00:33:16.156
Here we have an example in which an obvious effect—

L5-cue_451
00:33:16.156 --> 00:33:22.106
the irreversibility [of time]—is not an obvious consequence of the laws,

L5-cue_452
00:33:22.106 --> 00:33:28.206
but that the effect is rather far from the basic laws.

L5-cue_453
00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:33.216
It takes a lot of analysis to understand why this effect, and that the effect is

L5-cue_454
00:33:33.216 --> 00:33:37.816
of first importance-in the economy of the world, in the real behavior of the world,

L5-cue_455
00:33:37.816 --> 00:33:41.986
in all obvious things, my memory, my characteristics, the difference between past

L5-cue_456
00:33:41.986 --> 00:33:46.836
and future, are completely involved in this—and yet the understanding

L5-cue_457
00:33:46.836 --> 00:33:57.886
of it is not prima fascia available by knowing about the laws; it takes a lot of analysis.

L5-cue_458
00:33:57.886 --> 00:34:03.136
#It is often this way, that the laws of physics are different—the laws

L5-cue_459
00:34:03.136 --> 00:34:09.166
of physics do not have a direct obvious relevance to the experience,

L5-cue_460
00:34:09.166 --> 00:34:13.546
but that the laws are abstract from the experience to varying degrees.

L5-cue_461
00:34:13.546 --> 00:34:16.666
In this particular case, the fact that the laws are reversible,

L5-cue_462
00:34:16.666 --> 00:34:25.056
although the phenomena are not, is an example.

L5-cue_463
00:34:25.056 --> 00:34:32.406
There are often great distances between the details—the detailed laws—and the main aspects

L5-cue_464
00:34:32.406 --> 00:34:34.666
of real phenomena.

L5-cue_465
00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:38.326
#For example, it’s something of this kind: that if you watch a glacier from a distance,

L5-cue_466
00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:41.846
and you see the big rocks falling into the sea and the way the ice moves and so forth

L5-cue_467
00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:46.776
and so on, it isn’t really essential to remember that it’s made

L5-cue_468
00:34:46.776 --> 00:34:52.916
out of little hexagonal ice crystals—that the ice crystals are hexagonal—and yet the character

L5-cue_469
00:34:52.916 --> 00:34:58.716
of a little hexagonal ice crystal, if understood well enough, is in fact—the consequence

L5-cue_470
00:34:58.716 --> 00:35:01.366
of this is, in fact—the motion of the glacier.

L5-cue_471
00:35:01.366 --> 00:35:05.446
But it takes quite a while to understand (in fact, nobody knows enough about ice,

L5-cue_472
00:35:05.446 --> 00:35:10.126
no matter how much they study the crystal—yet—to really understand) all the behavior

L5-cue_473
00:35:10.126 --> 00:35:11.206
of the glacier.

L5-cue_474
00:35:11.206 --> 00:35:13.626
#But the hope is that if we do understand the ice crystal,

L5-cue_475
00:35:13.626 --> 00:35:15.736
we’ll ultimately understand the glacier.

L5-cue_476
00:35:15.736 --> 00:35:20.566
But there’s a large—in fact, although we’ve been talking in these lectures about the fundaments

L5-cue_477
00:35:20.566 --> 00:35:24.456
of the physical laws, I must say immediately that one does not,

L5-cue_478
00:35:24.456 --> 00:35:29.096
by knowing all the fundamental laws as we know them today, immediately obtain an understanding

L5-cue_479
00:35:29.096 --> 00:35:37.576
of anything much: it takes a while, and even then it’s only partial.

L5-cue_480
00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:42.456
#Nature, is as a matter of fact, seems to be so designed that the most important things

L5-cue_481
00:35:42.456 --> 00:35:48.756
in real world seem to be a kind of complicated accidental result of a lot of laws.

L5-cue_482
00:35:48.756 --> 00:35:54.336
To give an example: nuclei, which involve several nuclear particles—protons

L5-cue_483
00:35:54.336 --> 00:35:58.686
and neutrons—are very complicated; they have what we call energy levels.

L5-cue_484
00:35:58.686 --> 00:36:02.336
They can sit in states or conditions of different energy values.

L5-cue_485
00:36:02.336 --> 00:36:04.996
Various nuclei have various energy levels.

L5-cue_486
00:36:04.996 --> 00:36:09.406
It’s a complicated mathematical problem, of which we only can partly solve,

L5-cue_487
00:36:09.406 --> 00:36:12.236
to find the position of the energy level.

L5-cue_488
00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:18.016
#Now, you can understand that it’s complicated, and therefore there’s no particular mystery

L5-cue_489
00:36:18.016 --> 00:36:22.246
about the fact that nitrogen with 15 particles inside happens to have a level

L5-cue_490
00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:29.206
at 2.4 million volts, and another level at 7.1, and so on; the exact position

L5-cue_491
00:36:29.206 --> 00:36:33.986
of the levels is obviously a consequence of an enormous complexity.

L5-cue_492
00:36:33.986 --> 00:36:39.666
But the remarkable thing about nature is that the whole universe, in its character,

L5-cue_493
00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:45.416
depends upon precisely the position of one particular level in one particular nucleus:

L5-cue_494
00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:49.766
in the carbon 12 nucleus there’s a level at 7.82 million volts,

L5-cue_495
00:36:49.766 --> 00:36:57.606
it so happens-and that makes all the difference in the world!

L5-cue_496
00:36:57.606 --> 00:37:04.436
#The situation is the following: if we start with hydrogen (and it appears that in the beginning,

L5-cue_497
00:37:04.436 --> 00:37:09.196
or in the earliest times, the world was practically all hydrogen),

L5-cue_498
00:37:09.196 --> 00:37:13.806
then as the hydrogen condenses—comes together under gravity—and gets hotter,

L5-cue_499
00:37:13.806 --> 00:37:16.666
nuclear reactions can take place, and it can form helium.

L5-cue_500
00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:20.366
And then the helium can combine only partially with the hydrogen

L5-cue_501
00:37:20.366 --> 00:37:22.636
and produce a few more elements, a little heavier,

L5-cue_502
00:37:22.636 --> 00:37:25.656
but they disintegrate right away back into helium.

L5-cue_503
00:37:25.656 --> 00:37:30.206
So it was, for a while, a great mystery about where all the other elements

L5-cue_504
00:37:30.206 --> 00:37:32.706
in the world came from, because starting with hydrogen,

L5-cue_505
00:37:32.706 --> 00:37:37.876
the "cooking" processes inside the stars would not make much more than helium

L5-cue_506
00:37:37.876 --> 00:37:43.806
and a few others—half a dozen others; less, as a matter of fact—other elements.

L5-cue_507
00:37:43.806 --> 00:37:49.866
#Faced with this problem, Professor Hoyle said, that there is one way out (I think

L5-cue_508
00:37:49.866 --> 00:37:55.406
Edwin Salpeter also—he’s here, so I have to be very careful).

L5-cue_509
00:37:55.406 --> 00:38:02.636
If three helium atoms could come together to form carbon, we can easily calculate how often

L5-cue_510
00:38:02.636 --> 00:38:05.676
that should happen in the star—and it turned out it should never happen much,

L5-cue_511
00:38:05.676 --> 00:38:09.596
except for one possible accident: if there happened to be an energy level

L5-cue_512
00:38:09.596 --> 00:38:15.096
at 7.82 million volts in carbon, then the three helium atoms would come together,

L5-cue_513
00:38:15.096 --> 00:38:18.186
would stay a little longer than they ought to—[or would] have, on the average,

L5-cue_514
00:38:18.186 --> 00:38:20.606
if there were no level there—before they come apart.

L5-cue_515
00:38:20.606 --> 00:38:23.936
#Staying there a little longer, there’s enough time for something else to happen,

L5-cue_516
00:38:23.936 --> 00:38:28.986
and to make other elements: if there was a level of 7.82 million volts in carbon,

L5-cue_517
00:38:28.986 --> 00:38:34.246
then we could understand where all the other elements in the periodic table come from.

L5-cue_518
00:38:34.246 --> 00:38:40.786
And so, by a backhanded upside—down argument, it was predicted that there is in carbon a level

L5-cue_519
00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:44.556
of 7.82 million volts, and then experiments in the laboratory

L5-cue_520
00:38:44.556 --> 00:38:47.576
with carbon show indeed that there is.

L5-cue_521
00:38:47.576 --> 00:38:53.526
Therefore, the existence in the world of all these other elements is very closely related

L5-cue_522
00:38:53.526 --> 00:38:56.366
to the fact that there is this particular level in carbon.

L5-cue_523
00:38:56.366 --> 00:38:59.726
But the position of this particular level in carbon seems to us,

L5-cue_524
00:38:59.726 --> 00:39:03.156
after knowing the physical laws, to be a very complicated accident

L5-cue_525
00:39:03.156 --> 00:39:06.186
of 12 complicated particles interacting.

L5-cue_526
00:39:06.186 --> 00:39:11.496
#So I use to illustrate, by this example, that an understanding

L5-cue_527
00:39:11.496 --> 00:39:15.846
of the physical laws doesn’t give an understanding in a sense

L5-cue_528
00:39:15.846 --> 00:39:19.796
of understanding significance of the world in any way.

L5-cue_529
00:39:19.796 --> 00:39:28.936
The details of real experience are very far, often, from the fundamental laws.

L5-cue_530
00:39:28.936 --> 00:39:34.076
There are, in a way of speaking, in the world—we have a way of discussing the world,

L5-cue_531
00:39:34.076 --> 00:39:38.186
which you could call—we discuss it at various hierarchies, or levels.

L5-cue_532
00:39:38.186 --> 00:39:42.286
Now, I don’t mean to be very precise—there’s a level, there’s another level,

L5-cue_533
00:39:42.286 --> 00:39:46.696
and another level—but I will indicate by describing a set of ideas to you,

L5-cue_534
00:39:46.696 --> 00:39:53.926
just one after the other, what I mean by hierarchies of ideas.

L5-cue_535
00:39:53.926 --> 00:39:58.496
#For example, at one end, we have the fundamental laws of physics.

L5-cue_536
00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:04.096
Then we invent other terms for concepts which are approximate, which have, we believe,

L5-cue_537
00:40:04.096 --> 00:40:06.496
the ultimate explanation in terms of the fundamental laws.

L5-cue_538
00:40:06.496 --> 00:40:10.896
For instance, "heat"—heat is supposed to be the jiggling, and it’s just a word

L5-cue_539
00:40:10.896 --> 00:40:14.866
for a hot thing—it is just a word for a mass of atoms which are jiggling.

L5-cue_540
00:40:14.866 --> 00:40:17.876
For all that, fundamentally, we should think of the atoms jiggling.

L5-cue_541
00:40:17.876 --> 00:40:22.686
But for a while, if we’re talking about heat, we sometimes forget about the atoms jiggling,

L5-cue_542
00:40:22.686 --> 00:40:27.086
just like when we talk about the glacier, we don’t always think of the hexagonal ice,

L5-cue_543
00:40:27.086 --> 00:40:30.146
the snowflakes which originally fell.

L5-cue_544
00:40:30.146 --> 00:40:34.016
Another example of the same thing is a "salt crystal": looked at fundamentally,

L5-cue_545
00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:36.596
it’s a lot of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

L5-cue_546
00:40:36.596 --> 00:40:38.956
But we have this concept of "salt crystal,"

L5-cue_547
00:40:38.956 --> 00:40:43.856
which carries a whole pattern already of fundamental interactions.

L5-cue_548
00:40:43.856 --> 00:40:46.566
Or [an] idea like pressure.

L5-cue_549
00:40:46.566 --> 00:40:52.006
#Now, if we go higher up from this, in another level, we have properties of substances

L5-cue_550
00:40:52.006 --> 00:40:55.756
like "refractive index"-how light is bent when it goes through something.

L5-cue_551
00:40:55.756 --> 00:40:58.596
Or "surface tension"-the fact that the water tends

L5-cue_552
00:40:58.596 --> 00:41:01.336
to pull itself together—is described by a number.

L5-cue_553
00:41:01.336 --> 00:41:06.236
I remind you, that we have to go through several laws down to find out that it’s the pull

L5-cue_554
00:41:06.236 --> 00:41:10.076
of the atoms and so on, but we still say "surface tension," and don’t worry

L5-cue_555
00:41:10.076 --> 00:41:12.676
when we’re discussing surface tension of the inner workings,

L5-cue_556
00:41:12.676 --> 00:41:14.886
always-sometimes we do; sometimes we don’t.

L5-cue_557
00:41:14.886 --> 00:41:17.846
Go on up in the hierarchy.

L5-cue_558
00:41:17.846 --> 00:41:20.736
With the water we have the waves, and we have a thing like a storm.

L5-cue_559
00:41:20.736 --> 00:41:25.986
We have a word "storm," which represents an enormous mass of phenomena.

L5-cue_560
00:41:25.986 --> 00:41:27.546
Or "sunspot."

L5-cue_561
00:41:27.546 --> 00:41:31.306
Or "star," which is an accumulation of things,

L5-cue_562
00:41:31.306 --> 00:41:34.866
and it’s not worthwhile, always, to think of it way back.

L5-cue_563
00:41:34.866 --> 00:41:38.976
#In fact we can’t, because the higher up we go, we have too many steps in between,

L5-cue_564
00:41:38.976 --> 00:41:43.196
each one of which is a little weak, and we haven’t thought them all through yet.

L5-cue_565
00:41:43.196 --> 00:41:52.086
We go up in this hierarchy of complexity, we get the things like "frog," or "nerve impulse,"

L5-cue_566
00:41:52.086 --> 00:41:55.266
which, you see, is an enormously complicated thing in the physical world,

L5-cue_567
00:41:55.266 --> 00:42:01.166
involving an organization of matter in a very elaborate complexity.

L5-cue_568
00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:07.846
Then we go on, and we come to things—words and concepts like "man," and "history,"

L5-cue_569
00:42:07.846 --> 00:42:14.786
or "political expediency," and so forth—which is a series of concepts that we use

L5-cue_570
00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:17.746
to understand things at an ever higher level.

L5-cue_571
00:42:17.746 --> 00:42:23.666
Going on, we come to things like "evil," and "beauty," and "hope."

L5-cue_572
00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:32.746
#Now, which end is nearer to the ultimate creator, or the ultimate—or,

L5-cue_573
00:42:32.746 --> 00:42:37.656
I make a religious metaphor, which end is nearer to God?

L5-cue_574
00:42:37.656 --> 00:42:40.566
"Beauty" and "hope," or the fundamental laws?

L5-cue_575
00:42:40.566 --> 00:42:46.526
I think that the right way, of course, is to say that the whole structural interconnections

L5-cue_576
00:42:46.526 --> 00:42:52.156
of the thing is the thing that we have to look at, that the sequence of hierarchies,

L5-cue_577
00:42:52.156 --> 00:42:56.196
all the sciences and all the efforts—not just the sciences, but all the efforts

L5-cue_578
00:42:56.196 --> 00:43:01.166
of an intellectual kind—are to see the connections of the hierarchies,

L5-cue_579
00:43:01.166 --> 00:43:04.966
is to connect beauty to history, is to connect history to man’s psychology,

L5-cue_580
00:43:04.966 --> 00:43:08.806
the man’s psychology to the working of the brain, the brain to the neural impulse,

L5-cue_581
00:43:08.806 --> 00:43:12.716
the neural impulse to the chemistry, and so forth—up and down, both ways.

L5-cue_582
00:43:12.716 --> 00:43:17.916
Today, we cannot—and there’s no use making believe we can—draw carefully a line all the way

L5-cue_583
00:43:17.916 --> 00:43:21.376
from one end of this thing to the other; in fact, we’ve just begun to see

L5-cue_584
00:43:21.376 --> 00:43:24.666
that there is this relative hierarchy.

L5-cue_585
00:43:24.666 --> 00:43:28.916
And so I don’t think either end is nearer to God.

L5-cue_586
00:43:28.916 --> 00:43:34.366
#To stand at either end and to walk out off the end of the pier only,

L5-cue_587
00:43:34.366 --> 00:43:37.626
hoping out in that direction is the complete understanding, is a mistake.

L5-cue_588
00:43:37.626 --> 00:43:45.226
To stand with evil and beauty and hope, or to stand with the fundamental laws,

L5-cue_589
00:43:45.226 --> 00:43:48.686
hoping that way to get a deep understanding of the whole world

L5-cue_590
00:43:48.686 --> 00:43:50.916
with that aspect alone, is a mistake.

L5-cue_591
00:43:50.916 --> 00:43:55.936
It is not sensible either for the ones who specialize at one end,

L5-cue_592
00:43:55.936 --> 00:44:03.306
and the ones who specialize at the other end, to have such disregard for each other.

L5-cue_593
00:44:03.306 --> 00:44:05.716
(They don’t, actually, but the people say they do.)

L5-cue_594
00:44:05.716 --> 00:44:13.666
#But that actually, the great mass of workers in between, connecting one step to another,

L5-cue_595
00:44:13.666 --> 00:44:17.266
are improving all the time our understanding of the world—both from working

L5-cue_596
00:44:17.266 --> 00:44:20.536
at the ends, and working in the middle.

L5-cue_597
00:44:20.536 --> 00:44:24.466
In that way, we are gradually understanding this connection,

L5-cue_598
00:44:24.466 --> 00:44:29.856
this tremendous world of interconnecting hierarchies.

L5-cue_599
00:44:29.856 --> 00:46:00.000
#Thank you.
