##Title The Great Conservation Principles

L3-cue_1
00:01:41.296 --> 00:01:44.416
#When learning about the laws of physics, you find that there are a large number

L3-cue_2
00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:51.226
of complicated and detailed laws—the laws of gravitation, of electricity and magnetism,

L3-cue_3
00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:53.656
nuclear interactions, and so on, and so on.

L3-cue_4
00:01:53.656 --> 00:02:00.556
But across the variety of these detailed laws, there sweep great general principles,

L3-cue_5
00:02:00.556 --> 00:02:02.686
which all the laws seem to follow.

L3-cue_6
00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:07.036
#Now, these principles are, for instance, the principles of conservation,

L3-cue_7
00:02:07.036 --> 00:02:15.246
certain qualities of symmetry, the general form of quantum mechanical principles, and—unhappily,

L3-cue_8
00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:21.196
or happily, as we spoke about last time—the fact that all the laws are mathematical.

L3-cue_9
00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:26.366
#Tonight I want to talk about the conservation principle.

L3-cue_10
00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:33.386
#Now, the physicist uses all the ordinary words in a peculiar manner, which is unfortunate.

L3-cue_11
00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:40.756
For example, "conservation" (the conservation law) means this—the way he uses the word:

L3-cue_12
00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:44.696
that there is a number, which you can calculate,

L3-cue_13
00:02:44.696 --> 00:02:50.146
at one moment-and as nature undergoes its multitude

L3-cue_14
00:02:50.146 --> 00:02:52.986
of changes, this number doesn’t change.

L3-cue_15
00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:58.766
That is, if you calculate, again, this quantity, it’ll be the same as it was before.

L3-cue_16
00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:01.346
#An example is the conservation of energy: there’s a quantity

L3-cue_17
00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:04.076
that you can calculate according to a certain rule,

L3-cue_18
00:03:04.076 --> 00:03:08.546
and it comes out the same answer after, no matter what happens, happens.

L3-cue_19
00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:15.586
Now you could see that such a thing is possibly useful.

L3-cue_20
00:03:15.586 --> 00:03:20.586
It’s analogous to this: suppose that the physics, or nature,

L3-cue_21
00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:27.056
is made analogous to a great chess game that we are watching, with millions of pieces on it,

L3-cue_22
00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:29.596
and we’re trying to discover the laws or the rules

L3-cue_23
00:03:29.596 --> 00:03:35.246
by which the pieces move—and the great gods who play the chess play it very rapidly;

L3-cue_24
00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:39.506
it’s hard to watch, and it’s difficult to see, and we’re catching on to some of the rules.

L3-cue_25
00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.556
#But there are some rules which we could work out,

L3-cue_26
00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:45.756
which do not require that we watch every move.

L3-cue_27
00:03:45.756 --> 00:03:50.946
For instance, if there’s one bishop only on the board,

L3-cue_28
00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:54.446
since the bishop moves diagonally, it never changes its color.

L3-cue_29
00:03:54.446 --> 00:03:58.456
So if there’s a red bishop on the board, and we look away for a moment while the gods play

L3-cue_30
00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:02.586
for a few, if we look again, we can expect that there’s a red bishop on the board—maybe

L3-cue_31
00:04:02.586 --> 00:04:07.706
in a different place, but the same red bishop—I mean, the same color square.

L3-cue_32
00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:14.576
This is in the nature of a conservation law: we don’t need to watch the insides,

L3-cue_33
00:04:14.576 --> 00:04:19.126
but we at least know something about the game, anyway.

L3-cue_34
00:04:19.126 --> 00:04:23.416
#It’s true that in chess this particular law is not necessarily perfectly valid.

L3-cue_35
00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:28.026
If we watch long enough it could happen that the bishop is captured while we weren’t looking;

L3-cue_36
00:04:28.026 --> 00:04:32.266
a pawn went down to queen, and the god decided that it was better to put a bishop instead

L3-cue_37
00:04:32.266 --> 00:04:35.566
of a queen in the place of that pawn—and it was on a black square.

L3-cue_38
00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:39.846
And so, unfortunately, it may well turn out that some of the laws

L3-cue_39
00:04:39.846 --> 00:04:51.046
which we see today may not be exactly perfect, but I’ll tell you how it looks now.

L3-cue_40
00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:53.936
#I said that we use words in a technical fashion,

L3-cue_41
00:04:53.936 --> 00:04:58.126
and another word in this title is the great conservation principles.

L3-cue_42
00:04:58.126 --> 00:05:00.466
This is not a technical word; it was merely put

L3-cue_43
00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:03.206
in to make the title sound more dramatic—you could just

L3-cue_44
00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:05.396
as well call them the conservation laws.

L3-cue_45
00:05:05.396 --> 00:05:08.226
If you wish, there are a few conservation laws

L3-cue_46
00:05:08.226 --> 00:05:11.326
that don’t work-that are only approximately right,

L3-cue_47
00:05:11.326 --> 00:05:15.096
that are kind of useful—and we might call those the "little" conservation laws;

L3-cue_48
00:05:15.096 --> 00:05:16.846
I’ll mention one or two of those.

L3-cue_49
00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:19.996
#But the other ones that I’m going to mention are,

L3-cue_50
00:05:19.996 --> 00:05:24.536
as far as we can tell today, absolutely accurate.

L3-cue_51
00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:30.616
#The easiest one to understand is the one I’ll start with, and that’s the conservation

L3-cue_52
00:05:30.616 --> 00:05:36.566
of electric charge: there’s a number—the total electric charge on a thing—which,

L3-cue_53
00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:42.446
no matter what happens, doesn’t change—the total electric charge in the world, rather,

L3-cue_54
00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:46.286
is what doesn’t change: the charge may go from one place to another, but if you lose it here,

L3-cue_55
00:05:46.286 --> 00:05:53.036
you’ll find it over there—so the conservation is of a total of the electric charge.

L3-cue_56
00:05:53.036 --> 00:05:57.796
#This was discovered experimentally, or demonstrated experimentally,

L3-cue_57
00:05:57.796 --> 00:06:01.936
by—I am embarrassed to say, I don’t remember whether it was—I think it’s Faraday (but it

L3-cue_58
00:06:01.936 --> 00:06:07.976
might have been Franklin); anyway, it’s somebody whose name begins with F—and I know

L3-cue_59
00:06:07.976 --> 00:06:11.056
at least this much: that it isn’t Feynman, anyway.

L3-cue_60
00:06:11.056 --> 00:06:20.816
#At any rate, the experiment consisted of getting inside of a great globe of metal,

L3-cue_61
00:06:20.816 --> 00:06:26.286
on the outside of which was a very delicate galvanometer to look for charge on the globe,

L3-cue_62
00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:28.816
because small amounts of charge would make a big effect.

L3-cue_63
00:06:28.816 --> 00:06:35.026
Then, inside the globe, this experiment—that was named again with F—built all kinds

L3-cue_64
00:06:35.026 --> 00:06:40.886
of weird electrical equipment of every kind: he made charges by rubbing glass rods

L3-cue_65
00:06:40.886 --> 00:06:46.016
with cat’s fur; he made big electrostatic machines run inside, and so on,

L3-cue_66
00:06:46.016 --> 00:06:50.206
so that the inside looked like those horror movies laboratories.

L3-cue_67
00:06:50.206 --> 00:06:52.546
And during all these experiments, no charge developed

L3-cue_68
00:06:52.546 --> 00:06:55.046
on the surface; there was no net charge made.

L3-cue_69
00:06:55.046 --> 00:06:58.826
#When a glass rod was charged up with the cat’s fur,

L3-cue_70
00:06:58.826 --> 00:07:03.486
the cats fur-although the rod may have been (I forget, say) positive,

L3-cue_71
00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:06.906
then the cat’s fur would be the same amount of charge negative,

L3-cue_72
00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:11.276
because the total charge was never anything.

L3-cue_73
00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:15.026
If there were any charge developed on the inside, it would have appeared as an effect

L3-cue_74
00:07:15.026 --> 00:07:18.706
in the galvanometer on the outside—so the total charge is conserved.

L3-cue_75
00:07:18.706 --> 00:07:22.226
#Now, this one is an easy one to understand,

L3-cue_76
00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:28.246
because a very simple model that’s not mathematical at all will explain it.

L3-cue_77
00:07:28.246 --> 00:07:31.806
Suppose that the world is only made of two kinds of particles: electrons,

L3-cue_78
00:07:31.806 --> 00:07:37.346
and protons (there was a time when it looked like it was going to be as easy as that),

L3-cue_79
00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:41.086
and that the electrons carry a negative charge, and the protons a positive charge,

L3-cue_80
00:07:41.086 --> 00:07:43.116
so we can separate them-we can take a piece of matter,

L3-cue_81
00:07:43.116 --> 00:07:45.166
and put more electrons on, or less electrons.

L3-cue_82
00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:50.936
But suppose that electrons are permanent: they do not disintegrate; they never disappear.

L3-cue_83
00:07:50.936 --> 00:07:55.846
That’s all-that’s not even mathematical; that’s a simple proposition-and there you see

L3-cue_84
00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:58.716
that the total number of electrons (or the protons,

L3-cue_85
00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:01.216
rather) take away the number of electrons, won’t change.

L3-cue_86
00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:05.666
#(As a matter of fact, the total number of protons won’t change, and the total number

L3-cue_87
00:08:05.666 --> 00:08:07.796
of electrons won’t change, in this particular model,

L3-cue_88
00:08:07.796 --> 00:08:10.066
but we’re concentrating now on the charge.)

L3-cue_89
00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:14.646
#The difference-the contribution of the protons is positive, and the electrons is negative,

L3-cue_90
00:08:14.646 --> 00:08:20.366
and if these objects are never created or destroyed alone,

L3-cue_91
00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:23.596
then the total charge will be conserved.

L3-cue_92
00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:28.936
#I want to list, later on, the number of properties of conserved quantities,

L3-cue_93
00:08:28.936 --> 00:08:30.496
and I start with the one about charge

L3-cue_94
00:08:30.496 --> 00:08:34.606
that we’re talking about—and we mark down here that it is conserved.

L3-cue_95
00:08:34.606 --> 00:08:38.496
That’s the beginning; this goes yes.

L3-cue_96
00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.376
So that’s the first.

L3-cue_97
00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:42.406
The chart will expand as we go along.

L3-cue_98
00:08:42.406 --> 00:08:47.246
#This theoretical interpretation is very simple.

L3-cue_99
00:08:47.246 --> 00:08:51.386
But it was later discovered that electrons and protons are not permanent: for example,

L3-cue_100
00:08:51.386 --> 00:08:57.206
a particle called a neutron disintegrates—can disintegrate—into a proton and an electron,

L3-cue_101
00:08:57.206 --> 00:09:00.296
plus something else (which we’ll come to).

L3-cue_102
00:09:00.296 --> 00:09:04.126
But the neutron, it turns out, is electrically neutral.

L3-cue_103
00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:07.956
So although protons are not permanent, nor are electrons permanent (in the sense

L3-cue_104
00:09:07.956 --> 00:09:11.426
that they can be created from a neutron), the charge still checks out,

L3-cue_105
00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:15.576
because starting before we had zero charge, and afterward we have plus 1 and minus 1—so

L3-cue_106
00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:19.396
when added together, we get zero charge.

L3-cue_107
00:09:19.396 --> 00:09:29.526
#Now, another example of a similar trouble—not trouble, but fact—is this:

L3-cue_108
00:09:29.526 --> 00:09:31.556
there exists another particle

L3-cue_109
00:09:31.556 --> 00:09:35.026
which is positively charged—besides the proton—called the positron,

L3-cue_110
00:09:35.026 --> 00:09:37.606
which is a kind of an image of an electron.

L3-cue_111
00:09:37.606 --> 00:09:42.416
It’s just like the electron in most respects, except it has the opposite sign of charge—and,

L3-cue_112
00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:46.646
more important, it’s called an antiparticle because when it meets with an electron,

L3-cue_113
00:09:46.646 --> 00:09:50.136
the two of them can disintegrate—they can annihilate each other—and nothing

L3-cue_114
00:09:50.136 --> 00:09:51.946
but light comes out.

L3-cue_115
00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:55.066
#So electrons are not permanent—even them, by themselves:

L3-cue_116
00:09:55.066 --> 00:10:00.856
an electron plus a positron will just make light (well, actually, the light is invisible;

L3-cue_117
00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:06.156
it’s gamma rays, but it’s the same thing for a physicist, just the wave length is different).

L3-cue_118
00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:10.086
So a particle and the antiparticle can annihilate; the light has no electrical charge,

L3-cue_119
00:10:10.086 --> 00:10:15.166
but we remove one positive and one negative charge, so we haven’t changed the total charge.

L3-cue_120
00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:19.466
Therefore, the charge—the theory of this conservation of charge—is a little, slightly,

L3-cue_121
00:10:19.466 --> 00:10:22.886
more complicated, but still very unmathematical; it’s simply this:

L3-cue_122
00:10:22.886 --> 00:10:27.076
how many positrons do you have, how many protons, take away the number

L3-cue_123
00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:31.876
of electrons-and there are other particles, it turns out, in the world, that you have to check.

L3-cue_124
00:10:31.876 --> 00:10:35.486
#For instance, there are antiprotons; they contribute negatively.

L3-cue_125
00:10:35.486 --> 00:10:38.216
There are positive pi mesons; they contribute positively.

L3-cue_126
00:10:38.216 --> 00:10:42.836
Each particle in nature has—fundamental particles have—charges,

L3-cue_127
00:10:42.836 --> 00:10:46.876
and all we have to do is add the total number; whatever happens in any reaction,

L3-cue_128
00:10:46.876 --> 00:10:54.176
the total amount of charges on one side has to balance on the other side.

L3-cue_129
00:10:54.176 --> 00:10:58.246
That’s one aspect of the conservation of charge.

L3-cue_130
00:10:58.246 --> 00:11:02.696
#Now comes an interesting question: is it sufficient to say only that charge is conserved,

L3-cue_131
00:11:02.696 --> 00:11:05.826
or could we say—do we have to say—more?

L3-cue_132
00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:08.846
If charge were conserved because it was a real particle which moved around,

L3-cue_133
00:11:08.846 --> 00:11:11.106
it would have a very special property.

L3-cue_134
00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:15.296
The total amount of charge in a box might stay the same in two ways:

L3-cue_135
00:11:15.296 --> 00:11:17.486
it may be that the charge moves from one place to the other

L3-cue_136
00:11:17.486 --> 00:11:19.046
in the box, and just stays in the box.

L3-cue_137
00:11:19.046 --> 00:11:25.676
But another possibility is this: charge here disappears, and simultaneously over here,

L3-cue_138
00:11:25.676 --> 00:11:31.996
charge arrives-in such a manner, instantaneously related,

L3-cue_139
00:11:31.996 --> 00:11:35.136
so that the total charge is never changing.

L3-cue_140
00:11:35.136 --> 00:11:39.416
#This possibility for the conservation is a different kind than the other one,

L3-cue_141
00:11:39.416 --> 00:11:43.186
in which if anything happens that the charge goes away here, something has got to go

L3-cue_142
00:11:43.186 --> 00:11:46.046
through the—in between, something goes past you—if you stood there

L3-cue_143
00:11:46.046 --> 00:11:48.386
and watched, something would go by.

L3-cue_144
00:11:48.386 --> 00:11:53.406
#The second form of charge conservation is called local charge conservation,

L3-cue_145
00:11:53.406 --> 00:11:57.926
and is far more detailed than the simple remark that the total charge doesn’t change.

L3-cue_146
00:11:57.926 --> 00:12:00.846
#So you see, we’ve been proving our law (if in fact, it’s true),

L3-cue_147
00:12:00.846 --> 00:12:02.246
that charge is locally conserved.

L3-cue_148
00:12:02.246 --> 00:12:04.016
(It is true.)

L3-cue_149
00:12:04.016 --> 00:12:11.736
Then, it must be true—of course, nothing can be proved without some other things,

L3-cue_150
00:12:11.736 --> 00:12:16.186
but as I desire to show you from time to time as much as possible some of the possibilities

L3-cue_151
00:12:16.186 --> 00:12:21.976
of reasoning interconnecting one idea with another, I would like to show you an argument,

L3-cue_152
00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:23.646
which is fundamentally due to Einstein,

L3-cue_153
00:12:23.646 --> 00:12:27.586
which indicates that if anything is conserved (in this case I apply it to charge),

L3-cue_154
00:12:27.586 --> 00:12:31.626
it must be conserved locally, provided one thing:

L3-cue_155
00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:35.196
provided that if two fellows are passing each other in a spaceship,

L3-cue_156
00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:37.426
the argument about which guy is doing the moving

L3-cue_157
00:12:37.426 --> 00:12:42.346
and which one is standing still cannot be resolved by any experiment.

L3-cue_158
00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:46.496
#That’s called the principle of relativity—that the motion is relative, and that we can look

L3-cue_159
00:12:46.496 --> 00:12:50.266
at any phenomenon from either point of view, either from the point of view

L3-cue_160
00:12:50.266 --> 00:12:54.586
that the one is moving, and that this—say this one is standing still,

L3-cue_161
00:12:54.586 --> 00:12:58.176
and this one is moving, or the other way around.

L3-cue_162
00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:02.596
#Now, suppose I take this point of view that this one is the one that’s moving past him.

L3-cue_163
00:13:02.596 --> 00:13:05.456
(Don’t forget, that’s just temporary; you can also look at it the other way,

L3-cue_164
00:13:05.456 --> 00:13:08.246
and you must get the same phenomena of nature.)

L3-cue_165
00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:13.526
Now suppose that this man, who’s standing still, wants to argue whether or not he sees a charge

L3-cue_166
00:13:13.526 --> 00:13:17.156
over here disappear and a charge over here appear at the same time.

L3-cue_167
00:13:17.156 --> 00:13:23.226
In order to make sure that it’s at the same time, he can’t sit in the front of the ship,

L3-cue_168
00:13:23.226 --> 00:13:26.626
because he’ll see one before he sees the other on account of light—so let’s suppose

L3-cue_169
00:13:26.626 --> 00:13:31.066
that he’s very careful; he sits dead center in the middle of the ship, right here,

L3-cue_170
00:13:31.066 --> 00:13:33.816
and looks-he’s right in the middle, halfway in between.

L3-cue_171
00:13:33.816 --> 00:13:36.296
#Incidentally, I’m going to have another man doing the same kind

L3-cue_172
00:13:36.296 --> 00:13:39.836
of observation in the other ship.

L3-cue_173
00:13:39.836 --> 00:13:48.676
And now: a lightning bolt strikes, and charge at this point A is created, at a certain instant.

L3-cue_174
00:13:48.676 --> 00:13:52.426
And at the same instant, back over here at this place B on the other side,

L3-cue_175
00:13:52.426 --> 00:13:56.946
on the back of this—at the other end of the spaceship (funny—looking spaceship),

L3-cue_176
00:13:56.946 --> 00:14:03.326
the charge is annihilated—disappears—at the same time, which is perfectly consistent

L3-cue_177
00:14:03.326 --> 00:14:05.586
with our idea that charge is conserved,

L3-cue_178
00:14:05.586 --> 00:14:08.246
because if we lose one electron—we get one electron here,

L3-cue_179
00:14:08.246 --> 00:14:12.326
and lose one here, but nothing went in between.

L3-cue_180
00:14:12.326 --> 00:14:16.716
#He says it’s the same time—he watches; he sees it’s exactly the same time—because the light

L3-cue_181
00:14:16.716 --> 00:14:21.796
which comes from the bolt which created the [charge at] A reaches him at the same time

L3-cue_182
00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:27.286
as the light which comes from the flash of disappearance—we suppose

L3-cue_183
00:14:27.286 --> 00:14:29.026
that when it disappears there’s the flash,

L3-cue_184
00:14:29.026 --> 00:14:32.026
and when it’s created there’s a flash (so we can see what happened),

L3-cue_185
00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:34.976
and then we see the two flash at the same time—and since he knows he’s in the middle

L3-cue_186
00:14:34.976 --> 00:14:38.476
of the ship, he says, "Yes, when one disappeared, the other was created."

L3-cue_187
00:14:38.476 --> 00:14:40.936
#But: what happens to our friend in the other ship?

L3-cue_188
00:14:40.936 --> 00:14:44.806
He says, "No, you’re wrong, my friend; I saw A was created before B,

L3-cue_189
00:14:44.806 --> 00:14:50.696
because the light is coming out of A, but the man is moving toward it, because he’s moving,

L3-cue_190
00:14:50.696 --> 00:14:54.986
and the light hits him from the front before the light can reach him from the back,

L3-cue_191
00:14:54.986 --> 00:14:56.266
because he’s moving away from the light [at B].

L3-cue_192
00:14:56.266 --> 00:14:59.426
So by the time the light gets to here he’s got—moved over.

L3-cue_193
00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:05.696
#So he says, "No; A, you see, was created first, and then B disappeared—so for a short time

L3-cue_194
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:12.706
after A, after I saw A was created, B hadn’t yet disappeared, and I got some charge.

L3-cue_195
00:15:12.706 --> 00:15:15.946
#That’s not the conservation of charge, it’s against the laws."

L3-cue_196
00:15:15.946 --> 00:15:17.576
#So the other fellow says, "Yeah, but you’re moving."

L3-cue_197
00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:26.046
He says, "How do you know?"—and so on—"I think you’re moving."

L3-cue_198
00:15:26.046 --> 00:15:30.066
So if we are unable by any experiment to see a difference

L3-cue_199
00:15:30.066 --> 00:15:33.106
in the physical laws whether we’re moving or not, if the conservation

L3-cue_200
00:15:33.106 --> 00:15:38.486
of charge were not local, we could tell when were—you see, if it were not local,

L3-cue_201
00:15:38.486 --> 00:15:42.786
only a certain kind of man would see it work right, namely, the guy who’s standing still

L3-cue_202
00:15:42.786 --> 00:15:46.196
in an absolute sense, but such a thing shall be impossible according to Einstein, and,

L3-cue_203
00:15:46.196 --> 00:15:49.526
therefore, it’s impossible, according to the relativity principle,

L3-cue_204
00:15:49.526 --> 00:15:52.076
to have non-local conservation of charge.

L3-cue_205
00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:56.956
#This conversation—the locality of the conservation of charge—is consonant

L3-cue_206
00:15:56.956 --> 00:16:06.796
with the theory of relativity, and it turns out that this is true

L3-cue_207
00:16:06.796 --> 00:16:09.726
of all the conservation laws—not just the charge, as you can appreciate;

L3-cue_208
00:16:09.726 --> 00:16:15.316
if anything is conserved, it’s the same principle.

L3-cue_209
00:16:15.316 --> 00:16:18.656
Now, another interesting thing about charge, which has nothing to do

L3-cue_210
00:16:18.656 --> 00:16:21.916
with the conservation law and is independent of that, is a very strange one

L3-cue_211
00:16:21.916 --> 00:16:27.016
for which we have no real explanation today—and that is: that the charge always comes in units.

L3-cue_212
00:16:27.016 --> 00:16:31.266
#When we have a particle that’s charged, it’s got 1 charge, or 2 charge, or -1, or -2.

L3-cue_213
00:16:31.266 --> 00:16:35.606
It’s a nice little lumpy unit, and has nothing to do with the conservation of charge,

L3-cue_214
00:16:35.606 --> 00:16:41.636
but I can’t help writing down that it comes in units, the thing that’s conserved.

L3-cue_215
00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:44.926
It’s very nice that it comes in units, because that makes the theory of conservation

L3-cue_216
00:16:44.926 --> 00:16:47.516
of charge very easy to understand: it’s just a thing,

L3-cue_217
00:16:47.516 --> 00:16:52.676
which we count, which goes from place to place.

L3-cue_218
00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:56.516
#Finally, it turns out, technically, that the total charge of a thing is very easy

L3-cue_219
00:16:56.516 --> 00:17:02.026
to determine electrically, because the charge has a very important characteristic:

L3-cue_220
00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:07.706
it’s the source of the electric and magnetic field—charge is a measure of the interaction

L3-cue_221
00:17:07.706 --> 00:17:10.646
of an object with electricity, with electric fields.

L3-cue_222
00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:18.016
#And so the other item that we should put here on the list is that this is a source of a field.

L3-cue_223
00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:23.856
In other words, the electricity is related to the charge.

L3-cue_224
00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:28.256
So the particular quantity which is conserved here has two other aspects

L3-cue_225
00:17:28.256 --> 00:17:33.096
which are not connected with the conservation directly, but are interesting anyway:

L3-cue_226
00:17:33.096 --> 00:17:37.916
one is that it comes in units, and the other that it’s the source of a field.

L3-cue_227
00:17:37.916 --> 00:17:39.306
#Are there other examples?

L3-cue_228
00:17:39.306 --> 00:17:40.606
#There are many conservation laws.

L3-cue_229
00:17:40.606 --> 00:17:45.656
#I give some more examples of conservation laws of the same type as the charge in the sense

L3-cue_230
00:17:45.656 --> 00:17:48.356
that it’s merely a matter of counting.

L3-cue_231
00:17:48.356 --> 00:17:52.506
There is a conservation law called a conservation of baryons.

L3-cue_232
00:17:52.506 --> 00:17:55.266
A neutron can go into a proton.

L3-cue_233
00:17:55.266 --> 00:18:02.436
If we count each of those as one "p-en", then we don’t lose the number of "p-en"s.

L3-cue_234
00:18:02.436 --> 00:18:08.576
The word "p-en" is actually substituted by baryon, which is equally mysterious and meaningless.

L3-cue_235
00:18:08.576 --> 00:18:13.706
The neutron carries one baryonic charge unit, or represents one baryon;

L3-cue_236
00:18:13.706 --> 00:18:18.286
then a proton represents one baryon—all we’re doing is counting and making big words.

L3-cue_237
00:18:18.286 --> 00:18:23.526
So the total number—if this reaction occurs, the total number of baryons doesn’t change.

L3-cue_238
00:18:23.526 --> 00:18:26.266
#It does turn out, however, that there are other reactions in nature.

L3-cue_239
00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:30.836
For example, a proton plus a proton can produce rather a great variety

L3-cue_240
00:18:30.836 --> 00:18:36.236
of strange objects:—a lambda, a proton, and a K+, for instance.

L3-cue_241
00:18:36.236 --> 00:18:42.256
These lambda and K+ are names for peculiar particles.

L3-cue_242
00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:46.786
#Now from this one, you know you put two baryons in; you see one come out,

L3-cue_243
00:18:46.786 --> 00:18:49.196
so possibly one or the other is one [baryon].

L3-cue_244
00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:54.716
But if you’ll study the lambda later, you’ll discover that it very slowly—this is easy

L3-cue_245
00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:59.186
for it, and this is hard for it to do; it disintegrates into a proton and a pi,

L3-cue_246
00:18:59.186 --> 00:19:01.906
and ultimately the pi disintegrates into electrons

L3-cue_247
00:19:01.906 --> 00:19:06.116
and whatnot-but what you’ve got here is the baryon coming out again.

L3-cue_248
00:19:06.116 --> 00:19:11.246
So we think that the lambda has a baryon number, but the K does not, [it] has zero.

L3-cue_249
00:19:11.246 --> 00:19:15.086
#So in counting these other numbers, we have a similar situation

L3-cue_250
00:19:15.086 --> 00:19:21.516
with baryons-so we have charge, and then we have baryon number, with a special rule

L3-cue_251
00:19:21.516 --> 00:19:25.486
that the baryon number is the number of protons, plus the number of neutrons,

L3-cue_252
00:19:25.486 --> 00:19:30.136
plus the number of lambdas, minus the number of antiprotons, minus the number of antineutrons,

L3-cue_253
00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:34.096
and so on-it’s just a counting proposition; it’s conserved.

L3-cue_254
00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:40.206
It comes in units, and nobody knows, but everybody wants to think

L3-cue_255
00:19:40.206 --> 00:19:44.806
by analogy that it’s the source of a field.

L3-cue_256
00:19:44.806 --> 00:19:49.586
#We are trying to guess at the laws of nuclear interaction, and the reason we make these kinds

L3-cue_257
00:19:49.586 --> 00:19:53.146
of tables is, this is one of the trick ways of guessing at nature.

L3-cue_258
00:19:53.146 --> 00:19:56.746
If this is a source of a field, and this does the same thing, it ought to be a source

L3-cue_259
00:19:56.746 --> 00:19:59.936
of a field, too-too bad; so far it doesn’t seem to be,

L3-cue_260
00:19:59.936 --> 00:20:02.116
or for sure it isn’t anyway—we don’t know.

L3-cue_261
00:20:02.116 --> 00:20:04.366
Sometimes people think it is, sometimes not.

L3-cue_262
00:20:04.366 --> 00:20:09.776
We don’t know enough to be sure about that question.

L3-cue_263
00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:12.666
#Now, it turns out that there is a very peculiar thing—[but first] I would

L3-cue_264
00:20:12.666 --> 00:20:16.536
like to mention there are one or two more of these counting propositions,

L3-cue_265
00:20:16.536 --> 00:20:22.446
called lepton numbers, and so on, but you learn nothing new; it’s the same idea, just counting.

L3-cue_266
00:20:22.446 --> 00:20:28.326
#There is one, however, which is slightly different; [it] is that there are, in nature,

L3-cue_267
00:20:28.326 --> 00:20:32.856
characteristic rates, apparently, with these strange particles: there are rates of reactions

L3-cue_268
00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:37.696
which are very fast, and very easy reactions to do—and others that are very slow.

L3-cue_269
00:20:37.696 --> 00:20:43.106
(I don’t mean easy and hard in a technical sense, in actually doing the experiment;

L3-cue_270
00:20:43.106 --> 00:20:45.546
it’s got to do with the rates at which these reactions occur,

L3-cue_271
00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.216
when the particles are present.)

L3-cue_272
00:20:47.216 --> 00:20:51.196
Anyway, there’s a clear distinction between this kind of a reaction, and this.

L3-cue_273
00:20:51.196 --> 00:20:58.816
#It turns out that if you take only faster, easy, reactions, that there’s one more counting law,

L3-cue_274
00:20:58.816 --> 00:21:03.246
in which the lambda gets a minus one, and the K+ gets a plus one,

L3-cue_275
00:21:03.246 --> 00:21:09.446
and it’s called the strangeness number—or hyperon charge, rather—and the proton gets zero.

L3-cue_276
00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:16.526
And that particular rule is right for every easy reaction, but it’s wrong for the slow reaction.

L3-cue_277
00:21:16.526 --> 00:21:21.086
#Then, we have a conservation law called the conservation of strangeness or the conservation

L3-cue_278
00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:25.146
of hyperon number, which is nearly right,

L3-cue_279
00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:30.186
which is very peculiar-it’s why the stuff has been called strangeness,

L3-cue_280
00:21:30.186 --> 00:21:35.806
the number: it’s nearly true—nearly true.

L3-cue_281
00:21:35.806 --> 00:21:39.206
But in trying to understand the strong interactions, which are involved

L3-cue_282
00:21:39.206 --> 00:21:43.706
in nuclear forces (since, as far as the strong interactions are involved,

L3-cue_283
00:21:43.706 --> 00:21:48.816
the thing is conserved), that has made people propose that for the strong interactions,

L3-cue_284
00:21:48.816 --> 00:21:51.716
it’s again a source of a field—but we don’t know.

L3-cue_285
00:21:51.716 --> 00:21:56.346
#I bring these matters up to show you how the conservation laws are used to guess new laws.

L3-cue_286
00:21:56.346 --> 00:22:01.116
#Now, there are other conservation laws that have been proposed from time

L3-cue_287
00:22:01.116 --> 00:22:02.686
to time of the same nature as counting.

L3-cue_288
00:22:02.686 --> 00:22:05.846
For example, chemists once thought that no matter what happened,

L3-cue_289
00:22:05.846 --> 00:22:09.316
the number of sodium atoms stayed the same.

L3-cue_290
00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:12.676
But sodium atoms are not permanent; it’s possible to transmute atoms from one

L3-cue_291
00:22:12.676 --> 00:22:14.966
to another, so that one has disappeared.

L3-cue_292
00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.816
#Another law, which was for a while believed to be true,

L3-cue_293
00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:21.926
was that the total mass of an object stays the same.

L3-cue_294
00:22:21.926 --> 00:22:26.126
It depends on how you define mass, and whether you get mixed up with the energy, nowadays,

L3-cue_295
00:22:26.126 --> 00:22:31.086
and I will disregard this mass law until we come to the conservation of energy.

L3-cue_296
00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:37.736
But the mass conservation law has been contained in the next one, which I’m going to discuss now,

L3-cue_297
00:22:37.736 --> 00:22:44.876
which is the law of conservation of energy.

L3-cue_298
00:22:44.876 --> 00:22:51.096
#The law of conservation of energy is the most difficult, abstract one—and the most useful,

L3-cue_299
00:22:51.096 --> 00:22:53.476
as a matter of fact, of all the conservation laws.

L3-cue_300
00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:56.896
It’s more difficult to understand than the charge (and these other ones),

L3-cue_301
00:22:56.896 --> 00:22:59.056
because in the charge, (and these other ones), it’s obviously,

L3-cue_302
00:22:59.056 --> 00:23:04.276
merely—the mechanism is perfectly clear—it’s a conservation of the object (sort of).

L3-cue_303
00:23:04.276 --> 00:23:08.706
I mean not quite, because of this problem that we get some new things from old things,

L3-cue_304
00:23:08.706 --> 00:23:11.456
but it’s really a matter of counting.

L3-cue_305
00:23:11.456 --> 00:23:14.106
But the conservation of energy is a little more difficult: here,

L3-cue_306
00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:18.426
we have a number which is not changed in time,

L3-cue_307
00:23:18.426 --> 00:23:24.106
but the number doesn’t represent the number of any particular thing.

L3-cue_308
00:23:24.106 --> 00:23:29.746
I would like to make a kind of silly analogy to explain a little bit about it.

L3-cue_309
00:23:29.746 --> 00:23:34.646
#I want you to imagine that a mother has a very difficult child—well, not necessarily difficult,

L3-cue_310
00:23:34.646 --> 00:23:40.906
but she has a child—who she leaves alone in a room with 28 blocks—they’re indestructible,

L3-cue_311
00:23:40.906 --> 00:23:44.146
absolutely indestructible blocks, like the charges.

L3-cue_312
00:23:44.146 --> 00:23:46.456
The child plays with the blocks all during the day,

L3-cue_313
00:23:46.456 --> 00:23:49.746
and when the mother comes back she discovers indeed there are 28 blocks.

L3-cue_314
00:23:49.746 --> 00:23:52.556
She checks all the time the conservation of blocks.

L3-cue_315
00:23:52.556 --> 00:24:00.826
Well, this goes on for a few days until one day when she comes in, there are only 27 blocks:

L3-cue_316
00:24:00.826 --> 00:24:05.146
one block she finds later outside the window; he threw one out the window.

L3-cue_317
00:24:05.146 --> 00:24:09.996
#So first we must appreciate the conservation laws involved that you watch out that the stuff

L3-cue_318
00:24:09.996 --> 00:24:13.716
that you’re trying to check doesn’t go out through some wall.

L3-cue_319
00:24:13.716 --> 00:24:17.966
#The same thing could happen the other way—if a boy came to play with him and brought

L3-cue_320
00:24:17.966 --> 00:24:22.256
in some blocks; of course, those are obvious technical matters that you have to be careful

L3-cue_321
00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:28.896
of when you talk about a conservation law.

L3-cue_322
00:24:28.896 --> 00:24:34.806
#Now suppose, however, that when the mother comes to count the blocks,

L3-cue_323
00:24:34.806 --> 00:24:40.556
she finds there are only 25 blocks, but suspects that in a little toy box,

L3-cue_324
00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:42.956
in a box that the boy has, he has hidden the blocks.

L3-cue_325
00:24:42.956 --> 00:24:44.796
So she says, "I’m going to open the box."

L3-cue_326
00:24:44.796 --> 00:24:48.116
He says, "No, you cannot open the box."

L3-cue_327
00:24:48.116 --> 00:24:49.216
How can she tell?

L3-cue_328
00:24:49.216 --> 00:24:55.156
She says, "I am a very clever mother, unlike most," she would say; "the box weighs, I know,

L3-cue_329
00:24:55.156 --> 00:24:59.136
when it’s empty, 16 ounces, and each block weighs 3 ounces,

L3-cue_330
00:24:59.136 --> 00:25:01.766
so what I’m going to do is, I’m going to weigh the box."

L3-cue_331
00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:15.036
So she would have another thing: number of blocks seen, plus weight of box minus 16 ounces,

L3-cue_332
00:25:15.036 --> 00:25:19.986
divided by 3 ounces, and that adds always the same, for 28.

L3-cue_333
00:25:19.986 --> 00:25:23.886
Goes on for a while until it doesn’t check, but she notices that the dirty water

L3-cue_334
00:25:23.886 --> 00:25:28.406
in the sink is changing its level—so, we add the water level:

L3-cue_335
00:25:28.406 --> 00:25:39.196
height of water in sink minus 6 inches (which it is when there’s no block in it),

L3-cue_336
00:25:39.196 --> 00:25:44.416
divided by a quarter of an inch (which is the height that the water rises

L3-cue_337
00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:48.756
when a block is in the dirty water).

L3-cue_338
00:25:48.756 --> 00:25:53.086
#Now, as the boy becomes more ingenious, and the mother continues to be ingenious,

L3-cue_339
00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:59.576
more and more terms must be added on here—which all really represent blocks,

L3-cue_340
00:25:59.576 --> 00:26:06.396
but from a mathematical standpoint are abstract calculations—which are blocks not seen.

L3-cue_341
00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:10.366
#Now I would like to draw my analogy, and tell you what is in common for this

L3-cue_342
00:26:10.366 --> 00:26:13.286
and the conservation of energy, and what is different.

L3-cue_343
00:26:13.286 --> 00:26:18.426
Suppose that you never saw the blocks at all—that in any one

L3-cue_344
00:26:18.426 --> 00:26:21.586
of the situations, there were never any blocks.

L3-cue_345
00:26:21.586 --> 00:26:25.696
Then the mother would be always calculating a whole lot of terms, which she could call blocks

L3-cue_346
00:26:25.696 --> 00:26:31.056
in the box, blocks in the water, blocks in—and so on.

L3-cue_347
00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:36.196
But there are other differences: there aren’t any blocks, as far as we can tell,

L3-cue_348
00:26:36.196 --> 00:26:38.746
and the numbers that come out here are not integers,

L3-cue_349
00:26:38.746 --> 00:26:41.566
unlike the case of the blocks with the child.

L3-cue_350
00:26:41.566 --> 00:26:45.966
Suppose— I mean it could happen to the poor lady that when she calculates this number,

L3-cue_351
00:26:45.966 --> 00:26:49.596
it comes out 6 1/8 blocks, and when she calculates this number,

L3-cue_352
00:26:49.596 --> 00:26:54.706
it comes out 7/8 of a block, and the rest of them give 21; still 28—that’s the way it looks.

L3-cue_353
00:26:54.706 --> 00:27:01.216
#So, what we discover is, that we have a scheme in which we can find a sequence of rules—and

L3-cue_354
00:27:01.216 --> 00:27:07.456
from the rules, each one of the different kinds of calculations we call calculating the same

L3-cue_355
00:27:07.456 --> 00:27:11.686
"thing" (number of blocks, or energy) by different rules.

L3-cue_356
00:27:11.686 --> 00:27:15.616
Then we add all the numbers together, from all the different forms of energy;

L3-cue_357
00:27:15.616 --> 00:27:18.536
it always adds up to the same total.

L3-cue_358
00:27:18.536 --> 00:27:21.626
#But as far as we know, there are not real units—it’s not made

L3-cue_359
00:27:21.626 --> 00:27:27.906
out of little ball bearings—so it’s abstract; it’s purely mathematical: there exists a number

L3-cue_360
00:27:27.906 --> 00:27:33.676
such that you can calculate it, and it doesn’t change—I cannot interpret it any better

L3-cue_361
00:27:33.676 --> 00:27:34.156
than that.

L3-cue_362
00:27:34.156 --> 00:27:39.536
#This energy has all kinds of forms analogous to the blocks in the box,

L3-cue_363
00:27:39.536 --> 00:27:42.736
and blocks in the sinkwater, and so on.

L3-cue_364
00:27:42.736 --> 00:27:45.956
There’s energy due to motion; it’s called kinetic energy.

L3-cue_365
00:27:45.956 --> 00:27:51.196
There’s energy due to gravitational interaction; the gravitational potential energy, it’s called.

L3-cue_366
00:27:51.196 --> 00:27:56.066
There’s a thing called thermal energy, electrical energy, light energy, elastic energy,

L3-cue_367
00:27:56.066 --> 00:28:01.696
and springs, and so on; chemical energy, nuclear energy—and there is also an energy

L3-cue_368
00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:06.916
that a particle has from its mere existence, an energy that depends on its mass directly;

L3-cue_369
00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:10.836
that’s the contribution of Einstein, as you undoubtedly know.

L3-cue_370
00:28:10.836 --> 00:28:18.346
#(E=MC-squared is what I was talking about, which is the famous equation of this mystic law.)

L3-cue_371
00:28:18.346 --> 00:28:21.776
#Now, actually, although I mentioned a large number of energies, I would like to explain

L3-cue_372
00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:23.746
that we’re not completely ignorant about the thing,

L3-cue_373
00:28:23.746 --> 00:28:26.876
and that we understand the relationship of some of them.

L3-cue_374
00:28:26.876 --> 00:28:29.946
For example, what we call thermal energy is, to a large extent,

L3-cue_375
00:28:29.946 --> 00:28:34.166
merely the energy—the kinetic energy of motion—of the particles inside an object.

L3-cue_376
00:28:34.166 --> 00:28:39.836
What we call elastic energy and chemical energy both have about the same origin—namely,

L3-cue_377
00:28:39.836 --> 00:28:43.356
the forces between the atoms: when the atoms rearrange in a new pattern,

L3-cue_378
00:28:43.356 --> 00:28:45.736
some energy is changed—that quantity changes;

L3-cue_379
00:28:45.736 --> 00:28:47.516
that means that some other quantity has to change.

L3-cue_380
00:28:47.516 --> 00:28:51.066
So, for instance, if the chemical energy changes,

L3-cue_381
00:28:51.066 --> 00:28:55.496
then heat energy is changed—in burning something, the chemical energy changes,

L3-cue_382
00:28:55.496 --> 00:29:02.386
and you find heat where you didn’t have the heat before—because it all has to add up right.

L3-cue_383
00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:05.526
But elastic energy and chemical energy are both interactions of atoms,

L3-cue_384
00:29:05.526 --> 00:29:07.736
and we now understand the interactions of the energies

L3-cue_385
00:29:07.736 --> 00:29:11.396
of the atom-or those chemical interactions, or those interactions

L3-cue_386
00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:16.456
of the atoms-to be a combination of two things: one is electrical energy,

L3-cue_387
00:29:16.456 --> 00:29:21.286
and the other is kinetic energy, again—only the formula for it is quantum mechanical,

L3-cue_388
00:29:21.286 --> 00:29:24.616
instead of the usual; it’s a little different one.

L3-cue_389
00:29:24.616 --> 00:29:28.536
#Light energy is nothing but electrical energy, because light has now been interpreted

L3-cue_390
00:29:28.536 --> 00:29:31.196
as an electric and magnetic wave.

L3-cue_391
00:29:31.196 --> 00:29:35.606
#The nuclear energy has no—is not represented in terms of the others,

L3-cue_392
00:29:35.606 --> 00:29:40.206
but as a result of—what do we say—due to "nuclear forces"; well, we didn’t say anything

L3-cue_393
00:29:40.206 --> 00:29:42.656
but [that] nuclear energy is not connected yet to the others.

L3-cue_394
00:29:42.656 --> 00:29:48.466
I’m not just talking about the energy released; in the uranium nucleus there’s a certain amount

L3-cue_395
00:29:48.466 --> 00:29:52.876
of energy, and then when the thing disintegrates, it changes the amount of energy

L3-cue_396
00:29:52.876 --> 00:29:56.516
in the nucleus, but the total amount of energy in the world doesn’t change—so a lot of heat

L3-cue_397
00:29:56.516 --> 00:30:03.256
and stuff is generated in the process, in order to balance that thing out.

L3-cue_398
00:30:03.256 --> 00:30:10.956
#Now, this conservation law is very useful in many technical ways,

L3-cue_399
00:30:10.956 --> 00:30:13.816
and I wish I could give you a number of them.

L3-cue_400
00:30:13.816 --> 00:30:18.496
I’ll give you some very simple ones, to show you how—from the conservation of energy,

L3-cue_401
00:30:18.496 --> 00:30:26.156
and knowing the formulas for the energy (which are not those)—you can calculate (you can see

L3-cue_402
00:30:26.156 --> 00:30:27.746
what) some certain things have to happen.

L3-cue_403
00:30:27.746 --> 00:30:32.496
In other words, many laws are not independent laws, but are just secret ways of talking

L3-cue_404
00:30:32.496 --> 00:30:36.976
about the conservation of energy—or, better: knowing the conservation of energy,

L3-cue_405
00:30:36.976 --> 00:30:39.796
you can also understand a lot of [other] laws.

L3-cue_406
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:43.636
#The simplest one is a lever.

L3-cue_407
00:30:43.636 --> 00:30:47.396
If this is a lever on a pivot, and let’s say this distance is 1,

L3-cue_408
00:30:47.396 --> 00:30:55.586
and this distance 4 (one foot and four feet), then—but first, I must give you the law

L3-cue_409
00:30:55.586 --> 00:31:00.496
for gravity energy: the law for gravity energy is to take (if you have a lot of weight,

L3-cue_410
00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:05.356
you take) the weight of each weight, multiply it by the height above the ground,

L3-cue_411
00:31:05.356 --> 00:31:11.356
and add this together for all the weights; that gives all the gravity energy.

L3-cue_412
00:31:11.356 --> 00:31:15.876
Let’s put the ground right here.

L3-cue_413
00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:20.616
#Now, the problem is this: suppose that I have a one—pound weight here,

L3-cue_414
00:31:20.616 --> 00:31:24.746
just to make it—to make it more complicated, a two—pound weight here,

L3-cue_415
00:31:24.746 --> 00:31:33.726
and I have an unknown mystic weight on the other side: X is always the unknown,

L3-cue_416
00:31:33.726 --> 00:31:39.166
so let’s call it W—to make it look like we’ve advanced above the usual.

L3-cue_417
00:31:39.166 --> 00:31:42.336
#Now, the question is, how much must W be,

L3-cue_418
00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:48.396
so that it just balances—it swings quietly back and forth without any trouble?

L3-cue_419
00:31:48.396 --> 00:31:51.866
That means that the energy—if it swings quietly back and forth without any trouble

L3-cue_420
00:31:51.866 --> 00:31:56.256
when it’s set this way-when it’s tilted up a little bit (say for instance, that this has gone

L3-cue_421
00:31:56.256 --> 00:31:58.956
up one inch), the energy is the same.

L3-cue_422
00:31:58.956 --> 00:32:03.436
If it is the same, then it doesn’t care much which way, and it doesn’t fall over.

L3-cue_423
00:32:03.436 --> 00:32:07.036
So if this goes up one inch, how far down does this go?

L3-cue_424
00:32:07.036 --> 00:32:10.736
If you think about it quite a long time (this being one inch and that being four feet),

L3-cue_425
00:32:10.736 --> 00:32:16.726
you can figure out by proportion that this being one foot, this is a quarter of an inch.

L3-cue_426
00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:20.596
So that the rule says this: that before anything happened,

L3-cue_427
00:32:20.596 --> 00:32:24.186
all the heights were zero, so the total energy is zero.

L3-cue_428
00:32:24.186 --> 00:32:27.706
After the thing has happened, we multiply the weights unknown

L3-cue_429
00:32:27.706 --> 00:32:33.336
by the height—minus-a-quarter-of-an-inch, add the other weight—two by the height one—inch,

L3-cue_430
00:32:33.336 --> 00:32:35.906
and this should add up to the same energy as before.

L3-cue_431
00:32:35.906 --> 00:32:41.876
So that a quarter of W taken away from two is zero, and W must be eight.

L3-cue_432
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:47.076
#So that’s how we find the laws—I mean, that’s one way we can understand the easy law

L3-cue_433
00:32:47.076 --> 00:32:49.106
that you know, of course, the law of the lever.

L3-cue_434
00:32:49.106 --> 00:32:52.676
But it’s interesting that not only this one, but hundreds of others

L3-cue_435
00:32:52.676 --> 00:32:57.696
of the physical laws can all be closely related to the various forms of energy—so I illustrate

L3-cue_436
00:32:57.696 --> 00:33:00.416
that only to illustrate how useful it is.

L3-cue_437
00:33:00.416 --> 00:33:03.756
#The only trouble is, of course, it doesn’t really work.

L3-cue_438
00:33:03.756 --> 00:33:07.916
I mean, if you did that, it wouldn’t swing like this on account of friction in the fulcrum.

L3-cue_439
00:33:07.916 --> 00:33:13.516
If I had something moving, for instance—if it has kinetic energy, like a rolling ball,

L3-cue_440
00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:17.706
and it’s on a constant height, and it rolls along—and then it stops,

L3-cue_441
00:33:17.706 --> 00:33:18.896
that’s on account of friction.

L3-cue_442
00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:20.556
But what happened to the energy of the ball?

L3-cue_443
00:33:20.556 --> 00:33:24.416
The answer is that the energy of the ball has gone into the energy of the jiggling

L3-cue_444
00:33:24.416 --> 00:33:26.856
of the atoms in the floor and in the ball.

L3-cue_445
00:33:26.856 --> 00:33:30.716
#The world that we see on a large scale looks so nice when we polish a nice round ball,

L3-cue_446
00:33:30.716 --> 00:33:34.056
and so on-it’s really quite complicated when you look at it on a little scale:

L3-cue_447
00:33:34.056 --> 00:33:38.816
billions of tiny atoms, with all kinds of irregular shapes, looked at in detail.

L3-cue_448
00:33:38.816 --> 00:33:43.316
It’s like a very rough boulder, really, when looked at finely enough,

L3-cue_449
00:33:43.316 --> 00:33:45.136
because it’s made out of these little balls [i.e. atoms].

L3-cue_450
00:33:45.136 --> 00:33:48.406
The floor is the same way; it’s a bumpy business made out of balls.

L3-cue_451
00:33:48.406 --> 00:33:53.366
You roll this monster thing over the other, you can see that the little atoms are going

L3-cue_452
00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:58.466
to go snap, jiggle, snap, jiggle—and after the thing has rolled across,

L3-cue_453
00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:01.216
the ones that are left behind are still shaking a little bit from the pushing

L3-cue_454
00:34:01.216 --> 00:34:02.776
and snapping that they went through.

L3-cue_455
00:34:02.776 --> 00:34:06.766
#So there is left in the floor a jiggling motion, or thermal energy.

L3-cue_456
00:34:06.766 --> 00:34:11.946
And although at first it looks like the law of conservation is false, energy has a tendency

L3-cue_457
00:34:11.946 --> 00:34:15.396
to hide from us, and we need thermometers and other instruments

L3-cue_458
00:34:15.396 --> 00:34:18.086
to make sure that it’s still there.

L3-cue_459
00:34:18.086 --> 00:34:21.026
#The first demonstration of the conservation of energy (—oh:

L3-cue_460
00:34:21.026 --> 00:34:24.786
the energy is conserved no matter how complex the process, or no matter what,

L3-cue_461
00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:27.056
even when we don’t know the detailed laws)

L3-cue_462
00:34:27.056 --> 00:34:29.926
#The first demonstration of the law of conservation of energy, in fact,

L3-cue_463
00:34:29.926 --> 00:34:35.226
was not by a physicist, but by a doctor—a medical man.

L3-cue_464
00:34:35.226 --> 00:34:40.536
He demonstrated with rats that the total energy of the food put in before,

L3-cue_465
00:34:40.536 --> 00:34:43.986
and their heat generated by the—well, you burn food,

L3-cue_466
00:34:43.986 --> 00:34:45.586
and you find out how much heat is generated,

L3-cue_467
00:34:45.586 --> 00:34:49.756
and then you feed the rats the food—and oxygen—and it’s converted

L3-cue_468
00:34:49.756 --> 00:34:53.406
to carbon dioxide the same way as in burning, and measure the energy in that case,

L3-cue_469
00:34:53.406 --> 00:34:58.516
and you find out that living creatures do exactly the same thing as non—living creatures,

L3-cue_470
00:34:58.516 --> 00:35:02.106
that the law of conservation of energy is exactly as true for life, as not!

L3-cue_471
00:35:02.106 --> 00:35:04.806
As a matter of fact, it was discovered by this.

L3-cue_472
00:35:04.806 --> 00:35:08.246
#Incidentally, it’s interesting, that every overall principle that we know,

L3-cue_473
00:35:08.246 --> 00:35:13.796
that we can test on the great phenomena of life, work just as well as for dead things.

L3-cue_474
00:35:13.796 --> 00:35:16.576
That is, there is no evidence yet that what goes

L3-cue_475
00:35:16.576 --> 00:35:21.866
on in living creatures is necessarily different (it may be more complicated,

L3-cue_476
00:35:21.866 --> 00:35:26.346
but [not] necessarily different) than what goes on in non—living things—I mean as far

L3-cue_477
00:35:26.346 --> 00:35:29.476
as the physical laws are concerned.

L3-cue_478
00:35:29.476 --> 00:35:33.546
#Incidentally, this amount of energy that’s in the food—it’ll tell you how much heat

L3-cue_479
00:35:33.546 --> 00:35:37.546
and mechanical work and everything that’s generated, is what you read—when you read

L3-cue_480
00:35:37.546 --> 00:35:41.716
or hear about calories, you’re not eating something called calories;

L3-cue_481
00:35:41.716 --> 00:35:46.536
you’re eating that measure of the amount of heat energy that’s in the food.

L3-cue_482
00:35:46.536 --> 00:35:51.256
For people who like to-physicists always feel so superior, and smart, and so on,

L3-cue_483
00:35:51.256 --> 00:35:53.996
that people would just like to get them once on something—and

L3-cue_484
00:35:53.996 --> 00:35:55.946
so I’ll give you something to get them on.

L3-cue_485
00:35:55.946 --> 00:35:58.916
#They should be utterly ashamed of themselves,

L3-cue_486
00:35:58.916 --> 00:36:03.796
because they take the same thing—energy—and they measure it in a host of different ways,

L3-cue_487
00:36:03.796 --> 00:36:08.626
with different names, absolutely absurd: energy can be measured in calories, in ergs,

L3-cue_488
00:36:08.626 --> 00:36:12.626
in electron volts, in foot pounds, in BTU, in horsepower hours,

L3-cue_489
00:36:12.626 --> 00:36:15.506
in kilowatt hours-all exactly the same thing.

L3-cue_490
00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:20.196
It’s like having money, you know, in dollars and in pounds, and so on,

L3-cue_491
00:36:20.196 --> 00:36:23.896
but unlike the economic situation, where the ratio can change,

L3-cue_492
00:36:23.896 --> 00:36:29.076
these dopey things are an absolutely guaranteed proportion.

L3-cue_493
00:36:29.076 --> 00:36:33.386
If anything could be analogous to it at all, the only hope would be to say

L3-cue_494
00:36:33.386 --> 00:36:37.226
that there are 20 shillings to a pound, and that you have shillings

L3-cue_495
00:36:37.226 --> 00:36:40.496
and pounds-with one complication that the physicist allows:

L3-cue_496
00:36:40.496 --> 00:36:45.016
instead of saying he has 20 shillings to a pound, he says he has irrational ratios,

L3-cue_497
00:36:45.016 --> 00:36:51.726
like 1.6183178 shillings to a pound.

L3-cue_498
00:36:51.726 --> 00:36:53.746
In addition to that, you’d think that the more modern

L3-cue_499
00:36:53.746 --> 00:36:58.546
or high-class theoretical physicists would at least use a common unit, but you can find papers

L3-cue_500
00:36:58.546 --> 00:37:00.526
with degrees Kelvin for measuring energy,

L3-cue_501
00:37:00.526 --> 00:37:04.386
megacycles—inverse Fermis is the latest invention.

L3-cue_502
00:37:04.386 --> 00:37:09.146
We don’t need any more inventions; we should all measure the energy

L3-cue_503
00:37:09.146 --> 00:37:12.316
in exactly the same—we should measure the energy in one unit, and let it be done,

L3-cue_504
00:37:12.316 --> 00:37:15.316
instead of having all these different names.

L3-cue_505
00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:21.186
#It just shows that people are often also—they want to say, see, I should bring my little boy

L3-cue_506
00:37:21.186 --> 00:37:25.686
to show on the screen, so that the audience will understand that I’m human—well,

L3-cue_507
00:37:25.686 --> 00:37:29.126
the proof that physicists are human is the idiocy of all the different units

L3-cue_508
00:37:29.126 --> 00:37:32.046
which they use for measuring energy!

L3-cue_509
00:37:32.046 --> 00:37:43.256
#Now, we have a number of interesting phenomena in nature,

L3-cue_510
00:37:43.256 --> 00:37:45.786
which present us some curious problems with energy;

L3-cue_511
00:37:45.786 --> 00:37:52.836
[it] has recently been discovered some things called quasars, which are very far away,

L3-cue_512
00:37:52.836 --> 00:37:56.246
and they emit a lot of light—they’re enormously far away, and emit a lot of light,

L3-cue_513
00:37:56.246 --> 00:38:00.566
and a lot of radio waves—and have radiating so much energy,

L3-cue_514
00:38:00.566 --> 00:38:03.006
that the question is, where does it come from?

L3-cue_515
00:38:03.006 --> 00:38:05.626
That is, after it’s radiated this enormous amount of energy,

L3-cue_516
00:38:05.626 --> 00:38:09.416
the condition must be different than it was before, if the conservation of energy is right.

L3-cue_517
00:38:09.416 --> 00:38:11.966
#Question: does the thing collapse gravitationally?

L3-cue_518
00:38:11.966 --> 00:38:13.736
Is it a different condition gravitationally?

L3-cue_519
00:38:13.736 --> 00:38:16.716
Is it coming from gravity energy, this big emission,

L3-cue_520
00:38:16.716 --> 00:38:19.096
or is it coming from nuclear energy, and so on?

L3-cue_521
00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:20.126
#Nobody knows.

L3-cue_522
00:38:20.126 --> 00:38:24.506
#Would you like to propose that maybe the law of conservation of energy is not right?

L3-cue_523
00:38:24.506 --> 00:38:28.556
Well, when a thing is investigated as poorly—I mean,

L3-cue_524
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:34.646
as incompletely-as is the quasars (because they can’t see so easily at such a large distance),

L3-cue_525
00:38:34.646 --> 00:38:39.656
it very rarely is, when a thing looks difficult, that the fundamental laws are wrong;

L3-cue_526
00:38:39.656 --> 00:38:43.026
it’s usually that the details are unknown.

L3-cue_527
00:38:43.026 --> 00:38:48.166
Another interesting example of the use of the conservation of energy is in this reaction:

L3-cue_528
00:38:48.166 --> 00:38:52.226
it was first thought that neutrons turned to protons plus electrons,

L3-cue_529
00:38:52.226 --> 00:38:55.996
but the energy of a neutron is fixed, and that of a proton could be measured,

L3-cue_530
00:38:55.996 --> 00:38:59.336
and the energy of an electron did not add up correctly to the energy

L3-cue_531
00:38:59.336 --> 00:39:03.656
of the neutron-the proton and electron together didn’t add up to the neutron.

L3-cue_532
00:39:03.656 --> 00:39:04.886
#Two possibilities existed.

L3-cue_533
00:39:04.886 --> 00:39:08.256
One was the law of energy conservation is not right.

L3-cue_534
00:39:08.256 --> 00:39:10.806
In fact, it was proposed by Bohr for a while,

L3-cue_535
00:39:10.806 --> 00:39:16.146
that maybe the conservation law worked only statistically, on the average, for large scale.

L3-cue_536
00:39:16.146 --> 00:39:19.696
But it turns out that Fermi—I mean, Pauli—suggested, no,

L3-cue_537
00:39:19.696 --> 00:39:22.926
that the fact that the energy doesn’t check out is because there’s a something else coming

L3-cue_538
00:39:22.926 --> 00:39:26.106
out which we now call an antineutrino,

L3-cue_539
00:39:26.106 --> 00:39:28.606
and that this other thing coming out takes out the energy.

L3-cue_540
00:39:28.606 --> 00:39:31.816
#If you say, "The only reason for the antineutrino is to make the conservation

L3-cue_541
00:39:31.816 --> 00:39:35.726
of energy right," well, it makes a lot of other things right: conservation of momentum,

L3-cue_542
00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:38.646
and other conservation laws, are fixed up because a piece came

L3-cue_543
00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:43.296
out that we weren’t worrying about—and very recently it has been directly demonstrated

L3-cue_544
00:39:43.296 --> 00:39:46.246
that such neutrinos indeed exist.

L3-cue_545
00:39:46.246 --> 00:39:47.406
#That illustrates a point.

L3-cue_546
00:39:47.406 --> 00:39:53.046
Why are we able to extend our laws to regions that we’re not sure [about]?

L3-cue_547
00:39:53.046 --> 00:39:59.086
How is it possible—why are we so confident that because we check the energy conservation here,

L3-cue_548
00:39:59.086 --> 00:40:02.776
then—when we get a new phenomenon—we say, "It’s got to satisfy the conservation of energy."

L3-cue_549
00:40:02.776 --> 00:40:04.166
Every once in a while you read in the paper

L3-cue_550
00:40:04.166 --> 00:40:08.386
that the physicists have discovered one of their favorite laws is wrong.

L3-cue_551
00:40:08.386 --> 00:40:12.446
It’s not a mistake to say that it’s true in a region

L3-cue_552
00:40:12.446 --> 00:40:14.946
where you don’t look yet, where you haven’t looked yet.

L3-cue_553
00:40:14.946 --> 00:40:17.026
If you will not say that it’s true in a region

L3-cue_554
00:40:17.026 --> 00:40:20.176
that you haven’t looked yet, you don’t know anything.

L3-cue_555
00:40:20.176 --> 00:40:24.576
If the only laws that you find are those which you just finished observing,

L3-cue_556
00:40:24.576 --> 00:40:27.856
then you can’t make any predictions.

L3-cue_557
00:40:27.856 --> 00:40:31.826
#The only utility of the science is to go on and to try to take guesses, you see;

L3-cue_558
00:40:31.826 --> 00:40:34.846
the most likely thing is that the energy is conserved in other places.

L3-cue_559
00:40:34.846 --> 00:40:39.366
So what we do, always, is to stick your neck out—and that, of course,

L3-cue_560
00:40:39.366 --> 00:40:40.886
means that the science is uncertain.

L3-cue_561
00:40:40.886 --> 00:40:44.466
The moment that you make a proposition about a region of experience

L3-cue_562
00:40:44.466 --> 00:40:47.866
that you haven’t directly seen, then you must be uncertain.

L3-cue_563
00:40:47.866 --> 00:40:51.616
But we always must make statements about the regions that we haven’t seen,

L3-cue_564
00:40:51.616 --> 00:40:53.746
or it’s no use in the whole business.

L3-cue_565
00:40:53.746 --> 00:41:00.736
#For instance, the mass of an object changes when it moves, because of the conservation

L3-cue_566
00:41:00.736 --> 00:41:05.896
of energy-the energy associated with the motion appears as an extra mass,

L3-cue_567
00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:09.556
because of the relation of mass and energy—so things get heavier when they move.

L3-cue_568
00:41:09.556 --> 00:41:13.436
It was first believed by Newton that this wasn’t the case, [and] that the masses stayed constant.

L3-cue_569
00:41:13.436 --> 00:41:19.966
So when it was discovered that that was false, everybody’d say, "It was a terrible thing

L3-cue_570
00:41:19.966 --> 00:41:24.276
that physicists found out they were wrong—why did they think they were right?"

L3-cue_571
00:41:24.276 --> 00:41:27.836
The effect is very small—only when you get near the speed of light does it make any difference.

L3-cue_572
00:41:27.836 --> 00:41:30.486
If you spin a top, it weighs the same as if you don’t spin it,

L3-cue_573
00:41:30.486 --> 00:41:34.916
within millions-a very, very fine fraction.

L3-cue_574
00:41:34.916 --> 00:41:35.876
So you could say, "Oh!

L3-cue_575
00:41:35.876 --> 00:41:40.726
They should have said—they should have said—that if you do not move any faster

L3-cue_576
00:41:40.726 --> 00:41:44.726
than so—and—so, then the mass doesn’t change— that would then be certain."

L3-cue_577
00:41:44.726 --> 00:41:51.806
#No, the experiment [also] happens to be done only with tops made out of wood, copper, steel,

L3-cue_578
00:41:51.806 --> 00:41:56.446
and so on-so we [also] should have said that tops made out of copper, steel, wood,

L3-cue_579
00:41:56.446 --> 00:41:58.466
and so on, were not moving any faster.

L3-cue_580
00:41:58.466 --> 00:42:03.116
You see, we do not know all the conditions that we need for an experiment:

L3-cue_581
00:42:03.116 --> 00:42:07.136
it is not known whether a radioactive top would have a mass that’s conserved,

L3-cue_582
00:42:07.136 --> 00:42:08.726
but we have to take a guess.

L3-cue_583
00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:12.356
#So in order to have any utility at all to the science, in order not simply

L3-cue_584
00:42:12.356 --> 00:42:14.696
to describe an experiment that’s just been done,

L3-cue_585
00:42:14.696 --> 00:42:19.486
we have to propose laws beyond their range—and there’s nothing wrong with that—

L3-cue_586
00:42:19.486 --> 00:42:22.536
that’s the success; that’s the point.

L3-cue_587
00:42:22.536 --> 00:42:24.566
#That makes the science uncertain.

L3-cue_588
00:42:24.566 --> 00:42:29.016
If you thought before that science was certain, well, that’s just an error on your part.

L3-cue_589
00:42:29.016 --> 00:42:37.966
#Now there are other—so, we have here the energy, which we could put on our list,

L3-cue_590
00:42:37.966 --> 00:42:48.136
and it’s conserved perfectly, as far as we know—but it does not come in units.

L3-cue_591
00:42:48.136 --> 00:42:53.006
Now the question is, is it the source of a field—and the answer is yes.

L3-cue_592
00:42:53.006 --> 00:42:58.776
#Einstein understood gravitation as being generated by energy.

L3-cue_593
00:42:58.776 --> 00:43:01.876
Energy and mass are equivalent, and Newton’s interpretation

L3-cue_594
00:43:01.876 --> 00:43:04.676
that the mass is what produced the gravity has been modified

L3-cue_595
00:43:04.676 --> 00:43:08.996
to being the energy that produces the gravity.

L3-cue_596
00:43:08.996 --> 00:43:11.946
There are other laws that are similar to the conservation of energy

L3-cue_597
00:43:11.946 --> 00:43:13.146
in the sense that they are numbers.

L3-cue_598
00:43:13.146 --> 00:43:17.676
I haven’t very much time to describe them, but I’ll mention what they are.

L3-cue_599
00:43:17.676 --> 00:43:19.976
#One of them is the momentum.

L3-cue_600
00:43:19.976 --> 00:43:23.506
It means if you take all the masses in an object and multiply them

L3-cue_601
00:43:23.506 --> 00:43:28.406
by the velocities (for instance), and add it together, that’s the momentum-of the particles

L3-cue_602
00:43:28.406 --> 00:43:33.056
in it, anyway; that total amount of momentum is conserved.

L3-cue_603
00:43:33.056 --> 00:43:37.716
The energy and the momentum are now understood to be very closely related,

L3-cue_604
00:43:37.716 --> 00:43:43.016
and so they should be in the same column in this conservation law [table].

L3-cue_605
00:43:43.016 --> 00:43:46.706
#Another example of a conserved quantity is angular momentum,

L3-cue_606
00:43:46.706 --> 00:43:50.246
an item which we discussed some time before.

L3-cue_607
00:43:50.246 --> 00:44:01.496
The angular momentum is the area generated per second by objects moving about.

L3-cue_608
00:44:01.496 --> 00:44:08.536
For example, if an object is here, and is moving, and we take any center whatsoever,

L3-cue_609
00:44:08.536 --> 00:44:14.256
then—the area, the rate of change—the speed at which this area increases,

L3-cue_610
00:44:14.256 --> 00:44:18.566
multiplied by the mass of the object, and added together for all the objects,

L3-cue_611
00:44:18.566 --> 00:44:23.306
is called the angular momentum—and that quantity doesn’t change, either.

L3-cue_612
00:44:23.306 --> 00:44:30.696
#So we have conservation of angular momentum.

L3-cue_613
00:44:30.696 --> 00:44:33.796
#Incidentally, at first sight, if you know too much physics,

L3-cue_614
00:44:33.796 --> 00:44:39.366
you might think that the angular momentum is not conserved: like the energy,

L3-cue_615
00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:42.796
it appears also in different forms, although most people think it only appears

L3-cue_616
00:44:42.796 --> 00:44:46.846
in motion-but it does appear in other forms, and I will illustrate that.

L3-cue_617
00:44:46.846 --> 00:44:51.576
You know that if you have a wire, and move a magnet up into it, increasing the magnetic field

L3-cue_618
00:44:51.576 --> 00:44:54.226
through the flux through the wires, there’ll be an electric current—

L3-cue_619
00:44:54.226 --> 00:44:56.576
that’s how electric generators work.

L3-cue_620
00:44:56.576 --> 00:44:58.726
#Now, imagine that I have instead of a wire,

L3-cue_621
00:44:58.726 --> 00:45:03.916
a disk on which there are electric charges analogous to the electrons in the wire.

L3-cue_622
00:45:03.916 --> 00:45:10.456
Then I bring up a magnet dead center along the axis from far away, very rapidly, up to here,

L3-cue_623
00:45:10.456 --> 00:45:13.276
so now there’s a flux change through here.

L3-cue_624
00:45:13.276 --> 00:45:16.856
Then, just as in the wire, these will start to go around.

L3-cue_625
00:45:16.856 --> 00:45:21.946
If this were on a wheel, it would be spinning by the time I brought the magnet up.

L3-cue_626
00:45:21.946 --> 00:45:25.136
Well, that doesn’t look like conservation of angular momentum, because when it’s down here,

L3-cue_627
00:45:25.136 --> 00:45:28.666
nothing’s turning, and when it’s up here, it’s spinning.

L3-cue_628
00:45:28.666 --> 00:45:35.456
So we got turning for nothing—and that’s against the rules.

L3-cue_629
00:45:35.456 --> 00:45:38.546
#"Oh, yes," you say, "I know; there must be another kind of interaction

L3-cue_630
00:45:38.546 --> 00:45:41.136
that makes the magnets spin the opposite way."

L3-cue_631
00:45:41.136 --> 00:45:43.286
That’s not the case: there is no electrical force

L3-cue_632
00:45:43.286 --> 00:45:46.956
on the magnet tending to twist it the opposite way.

L3-cue_633
00:45:46.956 --> 00:45:50.586
The explanation is, that angular momentum appears in two forms:

L3-cue_634
00:45:50.586 --> 00:45:54.856
one of them is angular momentum of motion, and the other is angular momentum in electric

L3-cue_635
00:45:54.856 --> 00:45:58.196
and magnetic fields—and there is angular momentum in the field here,

L3-cue_636
00:45:58.196 --> 00:46:02.876
although it doesn’t appear as motion, and has the opposite sign to the spin.

L3-cue_637
00:46:02.876 --> 00:46:08.516
#If we take the opposite case it’s even more clear: if we have just these particles

L3-cue_638
00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:15.836
and the magnet here—and everything standing still, I say there’s angular momentum there.

L3-cue_639
00:46:15.836 --> 00:46:19.196
There’s a rotational effect; I mean, there’s an angular momentum

L3-cue_640
00:46:19.196 --> 00:46:24.036
in the field-there’s a hidden form of angular momentum; it doesn’t appear as actual rotation.

L3-cue_641
00:46:24.036 --> 00:46:28.736
When you pull this magnet down, and take the instrument apart, and all the fields separate,

L3-cue_642
00:46:28.736 --> 00:46:33.746
then the angular momentum that’s in the field has to appear now, and this thing will spin

L3-cue_643
00:46:33.746 --> 00:46:43.566
from the-the law that makes it spin is the law of induction of electricity.

L3-cue_644
00:46:43.566 --> 00:46:48.466
#Now the question as to whether it comes in units is very difficult for me to answer.

L3-cue_645
00:46:48.466 --> 00:46:52.566
At first sight, you’d say, it’s absolutely impossible that angular momentum come in units,

L3-cue_646
00:46:52.566 --> 00:46:56.346
because angular momentum depends upon the direction in which you project the picture.

L3-cue_647
00:46:56.346 --> 00:47:01.166
I said in another lecture that you have to look at this thing, and see how the area changes.

L3-cue_648
00:47:01.166 --> 00:47:04.626
If you look at an angle—if you had something turning this way,

L3-cue_649
00:47:04.626 --> 00:47:07.916
and you looked at it sideways—you wouldn’t see any area changing.

L3-cue_650
00:47:07.916 --> 00:47:10.976
If you looked at not—quite—vertical, but just a little bit off,

L3-cue_651
00:47:10.976 --> 00:47:13.886
you’ll see that the area changes a little bit different—a little bit different,

L3-cue_652
00:47:13.886 --> 00:47:15.796
if you come at a small angle.

L3-cue_653
00:47:15.796 --> 00:47:21.896
#So if angular momentum came in units, 8 units, and then you looked not exactly down at the 8

L3-cue_654
00:47:21.896 --> 00:47:25.116
but at a slight angle, it should look like a little bit less than 8.

L3-cue_655
00:47:25.116 --> 00:47:29.166
Now, 7 is not a little bit less than 8, it’s a definite amount less than 8,

L3-cue_656
00:47:29.166 --> 00:47:32.186
so the darn thing can’t possibly come in units.

L3-cue_657
00:47:32.186 --> 00:47:36.206
This "proof," however, is evaded by the subtleties and peculiarities

L3-cue_658
00:47:36.206 --> 00:47:40.586
of quantum mechanics: if we measure the angular momentum about any axis,

L3-cue_659
00:47:40.586 --> 00:47:44.366
amazingly enough it’s always a number of units!

L3-cue_660
00:47:44.366 --> 00:47:51.936
So what to say about this is, yes—but it’s not the kind of unit,

L3-cue_661
00:47:51.936 --> 00:47:54.956
like electric charge, that you can count them inside.

L3-cue_662
00:47:54.956 --> 00:47:59.436
The angular momentum, although it does come in units—in the mathematical sense that the number

L3-cue_663
00:47:59.436 --> 00:48:04.006
that we get in any measurement is a definite integer times a unit—we cannot interpret

L3-cue_664
00:48:04.006 --> 00:48:08.026
that in the same manner that we interpret this in the case of electricity,

L3-cue_665
00:48:08.026 --> 00:48:11.996
that there’s this one, and I see another one; you see those little six little units in there.

L3-cue_666
00:48:11.996 --> 00:48:13.996
You can’t see the units, you see, but it comes

L3-cue_667
00:48:13.996 --> 00:48:22.576
out always an integer anyway, which is very peculiar.

L3-cue_668
00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:29.066
#Now, there are a number of other conservation laws that I should include in the list,

L3-cue_669
00:48:29.066 --> 00:48:31.596
and I’ll just illustrate the type.

L3-cue_670
00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:36.396
They’re not as interesting as these; they’re not numbers, exactly.

L3-cue_671
00:48:36.396 --> 00:48:41.106
If the laws of physics are nice, and if were to start some kind of device off,

L3-cue_672
00:48:41.106 --> 00:48:44.436
with particles moving, which had a certain definite symmetry—suppose

L3-cue_673
00:48:44.436 --> 00:48:49.406
that we had some objects that were like this, and that the exact way that they were moving was

L3-cue_674
00:48:49.406 --> 00:48:54.656
such that it was bilaterally symmetrical—then, as the laws of physics go on,

L3-cue_675
00:48:54.656 --> 00:48:58.606
and all the collisions, and so on, you would probably expect (and rightly so)

L3-cue_676
00:48:58.606 --> 00:49:02.716
that if you’d look at this same picture later, it will be bilaterally symmetrical.

L3-cue_677
00:49:02.716 --> 00:49:08.136
#So there is a kind of conservation, a conservation of the symmetry character,

L3-cue_678
00:49:08.136 --> 00:49:14.476
which is—should be—in the list there, but it’s not like a number that you measure;

L3-cue_679
00:49:14.476 --> 00:49:17.216
it’s just, well, a symmetry character.

L3-cue_680
00:49:17.216 --> 00:49:20.846
#I will discuss it in much more detail in the next lecture.

L3-cue_681
00:49:20.846 --> 00:49:24.306
The reason it’s not interesting—it’s not very interesting in classical physics,

L3-cue_682
00:49:24.306 --> 00:49:28.366
because the times in which you get such nicely symmetrical initial conditions is very rare,

L3-cue_683
00:49:28.366 --> 00:49:31.586
and it’s not a very important or practical conservation law.

L3-cue_684
00:49:31.586 --> 00:49:35.566
#But in quantum mechanics, when we deal with very simple systems like atoms, and so on,

L3-cue_685
00:49:35.566 --> 00:49:40.116
their internal constitution often has this kind of symmetry (of some sort),

L3-cue_686
00:49:40.116 --> 00:49:44.106
like bilateral symmetry, or other, and then the symmetry character is maintained—it’s an

L3-cue_687
00:49:44.106 --> 00:49:46.616
important law for understanding quantum phenomena.

L3-cue_688
00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.136
#I should include it in the list

L3-cue_689
00:49:48.136 --> 00:49:55.496
of all the important conservation laws, but I will discuss it next time.

L3-cue_690
00:49:55.496 --> 00:50:04.196
#An interesting question is, whether there’s a deeper basis for these conservation laws,

L3-cue_691
00:50:04.196 --> 00:50:06.236
or whether we have to take them as they are.

L3-cue_692
00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:10.586
That, again, I will reserve for next time.

L3-cue_693
00:50:10.586 --> 00:50:18.566
I would like, however, to remind you that in making a popular speech on these subjects,

L3-cue_694
00:50:18.566 --> 00:50:21.526
there seem to be a lot of independent things.

L3-cue_695
00:50:21.526 --> 00:50:25.736
#But with a deeper understanding of the physics, of the various principles,

L3-cue_696
00:50:25.736 --> 00:50:28.076
there are deep interconnections between the things,

L3-cue_697
00:50:28.076 --> 00:50:31.076
so that one implies the other, in some way.

L3-cue_698
00:50:31.076 --> 00:50:36.866
For example, the relation between relativity and the necessity for local conservation, which,

L3-cue_699
00:50:36.866 --> 00:50:39.936
if I said that without the demonstration, would appear as some kind

L3-cue_700
00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:44.146
of a miracle-that the statement that you can’t tell how fast you’re moving implies

L3-cue_701
00:50:44.146 --> 00:50:48.316
that if something is conserved, it must be done not by jumping from one place

L3-cue_702
00:50:48.316 --> 00:50:55.076
to another-and here I would like to show you, or indicate, how the conservation

L3-cue_703
00:50:55.076 --> 00:50:56.816
of angular momentum, and the conservation

L3-cue_704
00:50:56.816 --> 00:51:02.616
of momentum (and a few other things) are, to some extent, related.

L3-cue_705
00:51:02.616 --> 00:51:11.816
The conservation of angular momentum has to do with the area swept by particles moving.

L3-cue_706
00:51:11.816 --> 00:51:19.996
#Now, if you had a lot of little particles here, and you took the center very far away,

L3-cue_707
00:51:19.996 --> 00:51:24.116
then the distances are almost the same for every object,

L3-cue_708
00:51:24.116 --> 00:51:28.166
and it doesn’t make much difference—so the only thing that counts in the area sweeping,

L3-cue_709
00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:29.836
or in the conservation of angular momentum,

L3-cue_710
00:51:29.836 --> 00:51:33.716
is the component of motion (vertically, say, in this case).

L3-cue_711
00:51:33.716 --> 00:51:37.846
What we would discover is that each mass, multiplied by its velocity vertically,

L3-cue_712
00:51:37.846 --> 00:51:43.546
added together, must be a constant—because the angular momentum is a constant about any point,

L3-cue_713
00:51:43.546 --> 00:51:47.496
and if that point is far enough away, then it must be only that the sum

L3-cue_714
00:51:47.496 --> 00:51:51.796
of the masses times the velocities is constant—and therefore the angular momentum

L3-cue_715
00:51:51.796 --> 00:51:54.486
implies the conservation of momentum.

L3-cue_716
00:51:54.486 --> 00:51:58.576
The conservation of angular momentum implies the conservation of momentum—and that, in turn,

L3-cue_717
00:51:58.576 --> 00:52:03.646
implies another thing, which is the conservation of another item, which is so closely connected

L3-cue_718
00:52:03.646 --> 00:52:07.756
that I don’t put it on the list: the principle about the center of gravity,

L3-cue_719
00:52:07.756 --> 00:52:14.186
that a mass in a box cannot just move—disappear here, and move over here

L3-cue_720
00:52:14.186 --> 00:52:17.786
by itself—that’s nothing to do with conservation: if you think, "Well,

L3-cue_721
00:52:17.786 --> 00:52:21.916
you still got the mass, and I moved it from here to here," charge could do that, but not a mass.

L3-cue_722
00:52:21.916 --> 00:52:23.926
#Let me explain why.

L3-cue_723
00:52:23.926 --> 00:52:27.546
Suppose, since the laws of physics are not affected by motions,

L3-cue_724
00:52:27.546 --> 00:52:33.626
that this box was drifting slowly upwards, and take a point not far away.

L3-cue_725
00:52:33.626 --> 00:52:36.966
Now, as it’s drifting upwards, if the mass were here, quiet in a box,

L3-cue_726
00:52:36.966 --> 00:52:42.086
in the beginning it has a mass here going up, and producing an area at a certain rate.

L3-cue_727
00:52:42.086 --> 00:52:45.096
After the mass has moved over here, if it’s going up at the same speed

L3-cue_728
00:52:45.096 --> 00:52:49.536
because the box is drifting, then the area would be increasing at a greater rate

L3-cue_729
00:52:49.536 --> 00:52:53.196
because there’s a bigger length this way, although the altitudes are the same.

L3-cue_730
00:52:53.196 --> 00:52:57.106
#But by the conservation of angular momentum, you can’t change the rate

L3-cue_731
00:52:57.106 --> 00:53:00.716
at which the area’s changing, and therefore, you simply can’t move one mass from one place

L3-cue_732
00:53:00.716 --> 00:53:03.816
to the other, if you don’t push on something else and get rid

L3-cue_733
00:53:03.816 --> 00:53:05.956
of the momentum or angular momentum.

L3-cue_734
00:53:05.956 --> 00:53:11.706
That’s the reason why the rockets in empty space can’t go—but they do go:

L3-cue_735
00:53:11.706 --> 00:53:17.606
that’s because we have—the rocket—the center of gravity—if you figured it out with a lot

L3-cue_736
00:53:17.606 --> 00:53:22.146
of masses, if you move one forward, you got to move others back, so that the total motion back

L3-cue_737
00:53:22.146 --> 00:53:25.016
and forth of all the masses is nothing.

L3-cue_738
00:53:25.016 --> 00:53:31.956
#Now, the way a rocket works is: here’s a rocket, which shoots some gas out of the back.

L3-cue_739
00:53:31.956 --> 00:53:37.306
Here’s the gas-you see, beforehand the rocket standing still, say, in empty space,

L3-cue_740
00:53:37.306 --> 00:53:41.346
and afterwards it shoots some stuff out the back—and then the rocket’s going forward.

L3-cue_741
00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:45.826
The point is, that of all of the stuff in the world, the center of mass,

L3-cue_742
00:53:45.826 --> 00:53:49.336
the average of all the mass, is still right where it was before.

L3-cue_743
00:53:49.336 --> 00:53:52.776
But the interesting part has moved out here, and an uninteresting part,

L3-cue_744
00:53:52.776 --> 00:53:54.776
that we don’t care about, has moved out here.

L3-cue_745
00:53:54.776 --> 00:53:57.196
There is no theorem that says that the interesting things

L3-cue_746
00:53:57.196 --> 00:54:05.706
in the world are conserved, only the total of everything.

L3-cue_747
00:54:05.706 --> 00:54:11.376
#Discovering the laws of physics is like trying to put the pieces together of a jigsaw puzzle:

L3-cue_748
00:54:11.376 --> 00:54:15.636
we have all these different pieces, and today they’re proliferating rapidly;

L3-cue_749
00:54:15.636 --> 00:54:18.926
they’re lying about—many of them can’t be fitted with other ones.

L3-cue_750
00:54:18.926 --> 00:54:21.896
Now, how do we know that they belong together?

L3-cue_751
00:54:21.896 --> 00:54:27.276
How do we know that they really are parts of one picture, one at present incomplete picture?

L3-cue_752
00:54:27.276 --> 00:54:31.636
We’re not sure, and it worries us to some extent, but we get encouragement

L3-cue_753
00:54:31.636 --> 00:54:36.946
from the common characteristics of several pieces: they all show blue sky,

L3-cue_754
00:54:36.946 --> 00:54:39.716
or they’re all made out of the same kind of wood.

L3-cue_755
00:54:39.716 --> 00:56:03.000
#Thank you very much.
