##Title Symmetry in Physical Law

L4-cue_1
00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:53.236
#Symmetry seems to be absolutely fascinating to the human mind.

L4-cue_2
00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:58.106
We like to look at symmetrical things in nature such as balls, which are perfectly symmetrical,

L4-cue_3
00:01:58.106 --> 00:02:05.306
spheres—like planets and the sun, and so on—or symmetrical crystals, snowflakes,

L4-cue_4
00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:08.706
flowers (which are nearly symmetrical), and so on.

L4-cue_5
00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:13.296
But it’s not the objects in nature—the symmetry of the objects in nature—that I want to talk

L4-cue_6
00:02:13.296 --> 00:02:18.546
about tonight, it’s rather the symmetry of the physical laws themselves.

L4-cue_7
00:02:18.546 --> 00:02:21.036
#Now, how can a physical law have a symmetry?

L4-cue_8
00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:25.346
It’s easy to understand how an object has a symmetry; of course, it can’t.

L4-cue_9
00:02:25.346 --> 00:02:30.756
But physicists delight themselves by using ordinary words for something else, and so,

L4-cue_10
00:02:30.756 --> 00:02:36.666
in this case, they have a thing about the physical laws which is very close to symmetry

L4-cue_11
00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:38.986
of objects, and they call it the "symmetry

L4-cue_12
00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:41.846
of the laws"-and that’s what I’m going to talk about.

L4-cue_13
00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:49.276
#To show how close it is, I asked for a definition of symmetrical: what is symmetry?

L4-cue_14
00:02:49.276 --> 00:02:55.006
If you look at me, I’m symmetrical right and left—apparently, at least.

L4-cue_15
00:02:55.006 --> 00:02:58.976
A vase can be symmetrical that particular way, or in other ways.

L4-cue_16
00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:01.476
How can you define it?

L4-cue_17
00:03:01.476 --> 00:03:07.356
Well, Professor Weyl, a mathematician, gave an excellent definition of symmetry; it is this:

L4-cue_18
00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:10.936
as I am left and right symmetric, that means that if you put everything that’s on this side

L4-cue_19
00:03:10.936 --> 00:03:14.726
on this side—and vice versa, if you just exchange the two sides—it’ll look exactly

L4-cue_20
00:03:14.726 --> 00:03:16.556
the same.

L4-cue_21
00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:19.326
#Or, for instance, a square has a symmetry—

L4-cue_22
00:03:19.326 --> 00:03:24.576
a special kind: if I turn it around to 90 degrees, it still looks exactly the same.

L4-cue_23
00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:30.426
So, Weyl said, a thing is symmetrical if there’s something that you can do to it,

L4-cue_24
00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:36.856
so that after you’re finished doing it, it looks the same as it did before.

L4-cue_25
00:03:36.856 --> 00:03:41.656
That is the sense in which we say that the laws of physics are symmetrical:

L4-cue_26
00:03:41.656 --> 00:03:45.726
that there are things that we can do to the physical laws,

L4-cue_27
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:49.196
or to our way of representing the physical laws, which make no difference

L4-cue_28
00:03:49.196 --> 00:03:51.936
and leave everything unchanged in its effects.

L4-cue_29
00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:55.776
#This aspect of physical laws are what’s going to concern us tonight.

L4-cue_30
00:03:55.776 --> 00:04:01.786
We will take a number of examples.

L4-cue_31
00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:06.266
#The simplest example of all, of a kind of symmetry (as you’ll see,

L4-cue_32
00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:11.126
it’s not the same as you would have thought—left and right symmetric, or anything like that),

L4-cue_33
00:04:11.126 --> 00:04:15.306
is a symmetry called translation in space.

L4-cue_34
00:04:15.306 --> 00:04:20.446
That has the following meaning: if you build any kind of apparatus, or do any kind of experiment

L4-cue_35
00:04:20.446 --> 00:04:26.296
with some things, and then go and build the same apparatus with the same—do the same kind

L4-cue_36
00:04:26.296 --> 00:04:30.756
of experiment with similar things, but put them here instead of there (merely translate it

L4-cue_37
00:04:30.756 --> 00:04:37.086
from one place to the other in space), then the same thing will happen in the translated thing

L4-cue_38
00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:38.826
that would have happened in the original thing.

L4-cue_39
00:04:38.826 --> 00:04:45.976
#(It’s not really true, actually: if I actually built such an apparatus,

L4-cue_40
00:04:45.976 --> 00:04:50.086
and then displaced it 20 feet in that direction, it would get into the wall,

L4-cue_41
00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.606
and there would be difficulties.)

L4-cue_42
00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:59.406
It’s necessary, in defining this idea, to take into account everything

L4-cue_43
00:04:59.406 --> 00:05:04.826
that might affect the situation—so that when you move the thing, you move everything.

L4-cue_44
00:05:04.826 --> 00:05:13.196
For example, if the system involved a pendulum, and I moved it 20,000 miles to the right,

L4-cue_45
00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:16.326
it wouldn’t work right any more, because the pendulum involves the attraction

L4-cue_46
00:05:16.326 --> 00:05:19.286
of the earth-but if I imagine I move the earth and the equipment,

L4-cue_47
00:05:19.286 --> 00:05:21.976
then it will behave the same way.

L4-cue_48
00:05:21.976 --> 00:05:25.796
So the problem-the situation is, that you must translate everything

L4-cue_49
00:05:25.796 --> 00:05:28.426
which may have any influence on the situation.

L4-cue_50
00:05:28.426 --> 00:05:34.126
#Now, that sounds a little dopey, because it sounds like, "Well, uh just translate it,

L4-cue_51
00:05:34.126 --> 00:05:41.796
and if it doesn’t work, then you didn’t translate enough stuff!"—you’re bound to win.

L4-cue_52
00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:46.546
Actually, not: you see, it’s not self—evident that you’re bound to win.

L4-cue_53
00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:51.316
The remarkable thing about nature is that it is possible to translate enough stuff

L4-cue_54
00:05:51.316 --> 00:05:54.666
so that it does behave the same way—that’s a positive statement.

L4-cue_55
00:05:54.666 --> 00:06:00.916
#Now, I would like to illustrate that such a thing is true from the statement of the law

L4-cue_56
00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:06.966
of gravitation, for example, which said that the forces between the objects was inversely

L4-cue_57
00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:11.386
as the square of the distance between them—and I remind you that a thing responds to a force

L4-cue_58
00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:16.046
by changing its velocity, as time goes on, in the direction of the force.

L4-cue_59
00:06:16.046 --> 00:06:22.706
Now, if I move something from here to here—a pair of objects like a planet going

L4-cue_60
00:06:22.706 --> 00:06:27.546
around the sun-and move the whole pair over, then the distance between the objects,

L4-cue_61
00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:29.856
of course, doesn’t change, and so the forces don’t change.

L4-cue_62
00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:34.986
And further, when they moved over a situation at the same speed, then all the changes will remain

L4-cue_63
00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:38.786
in proportion; everything will go around in the two systems exactly the same way.

L4-cue_64
00:06:38.786 --> 00:06:44.226
Because the law said, the distance between the objects—rather than some absolute distance

L4-cue_65
00:06:44.226 --> 00:06:48.436
from the central eye of the universe, but it talked about distance

L4-cue_66
00:06:48.436 --> 00:06:54.326
between the objects—then it means that the laws are translatable in space.

L4-cue_67
00:06:54.326 --> 00:06:56.876
#I give another example of symmetry.

L4-cue_68
00:06:56.876 --> 00:07:01.756
That first symmetry is translates in space; the next one could be called translation in time,

L4-cue_69
00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:06.786
if you like, but better just to say, "A delay in time makes no difference":

L4-cue_70
00:07:06.786 --> 00:07:13.356
if we start a planet going around the sun in a certain direction (this goes around),

L4-cue_71
00:07:13.356 --> 00:07:17.756
and if we start it all over again two hours later—or, say, two years later,

L4-cue_72
00:07:17.756 --> 00:07:20.506
with another beginning, starting the planet and the sun going

L4-cue_73
00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:23.516
in the same way—it’ll behave in exactly the same way.

L4-cue_74
00:07:23.516 --> 00:07:29.016
Because, again, the law of gravitation, as stated, talks about the velocity,

L4-cue_75
00:07:29.016 --> 00:07:30.936
and never talks about the absolute time,

L4-cue_76
00:07:30.936 --> 00:07:38.256
and when you were supposed to start measuring things.

L4-cue_77
00:07:38.256 --> 00:07:42.466
#In this particular example, we are really not sure: when we discussed gravitation,

L4-cue_78
00:07:42.466 --> 00:07:46.856
we talked about the possibility that the force of the gravity changed with time.

L4-cue_79
00:07:46.856 --> 00:07:52.066
Now this would mean that the translation in time was not a valid proposition,

L4-cue_80
00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:56.766
because if the constant of gravitation is weaker a billion years hence than now,

L4-cue_81
00:07:56.766 --> 00:08:01.576
then it isn’t true that the motion will be exactly the same for an experimental sun

L4-cue_82
00:08:01.576 --> 00:08:05.206
and planet a billion years from now, as it is now.

L4-cue_83
00:08:05.206 --> 00:08:09.196
But as far as we know today—I discuss only the laws

L4-cue_84
00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:14.126
as we know them today (I wish I could discuss the laws as we will know them tomorrow,

L4-cue_85
00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:21.196
but I cannot.) but as far as we know—a delay in time makes no difference.

L4-cue_86
00:08:21.196 --> 00:08:24.716
Actually, we know that isn’t really true.

L4-cue_87
00:08:24.716 --> 00:08:30.586
That’s true for what we now call a physical law, but one of the facts of the world,

L4-cue_88
00:08:30.586 --> 00:08:34.976
which is very different-well, which just may be very different, and may be not different

L4-cue_89
00:08:34.976 --> 00:08:40.076
than a physical law—is the fact that it looks like the universe had a definite time

L4-cue_90
00:08:40.076 --> 00:08:43.046
of beginning, that everything is exploding apart.

L4-cue_91
00:08:43.046 --> 00:08:47.036
#Now, that, you might call a condition of geography, analogous to the situation

L4-cue_92
00:08:47.036 --> 00:08:51.676
that if I say "I translate," [and] I don’t translate everything—I mean,

L4-cue_93
00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.576
I have to move that wall, if it’s going to make any difference.

L4-cue_94
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:56.576
And in the same sense, you would say, "Oh, I see;

L4-cue_95
00:08:56.576 --> 00:08:58.916
he means the laws are the same—the universe expanded,

L4-cue_96
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:01.746
and everything else—but we could have made another analysis

L4-cue_97
00:09:01.746 --> 00:09:04.576
in which we start the universe later."

L4-cue_98
00:09:04.576 --> 00:09:08.856
#But we don’t start the universe, and we have no control on the situation.

L4-cue_99
00:09:08.856 --> 00:09:12.396
And we have no way to define that idea experimentally.

L4-cue_100
00:09:12.396 --> 00:09:16.866
Therefore, as far as the science is concerned, there really is no way to tell.

L4-cue_101
00:09:16.866 --> 00:09:20.986
The fact of the matter is, that the conditions of the world are changing in time (as we know,

L4-cue_102
00:09:20.986 --> 00:09:25.206
apparently); at least the galaxies are all separating from one another—so if you were

L4-cue_103
00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:29.386
to awake in some science fiction story, at an unknown time,

L4-cue_104
00:09:29.386 --> 00:09:32.216
[then] by measuring the distances (the average distances to the galaxies),

L4-cue_105
00:09:32.216 --> 00:09:34.446
you could tell when it was—and that means

L4-cue_106
00:09:34.446 --> 00:09:39.056
that the world will not look the same, if delayed in time.

L4-cue_107
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:43.526
Now, it is conventional today to separate the physical laws which tell how things will move,

L4-cue_108
00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:46.526
if you start them at a given condition, from the statement

L4-cue_109
00:09:46.526 --> 00:09:50.116
of how the world actually began—because we know so little about that,

L4-cue_110
00:09:50.116 --> 00:09:54.486
and it is usually considered that astronomical history (or cosmological history,

L4-cue_111
00:09:54.486 --> 00:09:59.016
or whatever you want) is a little different than physical laws—but if put to a test

L4-cue_112
00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.576
of how would you define the difference, I would be hard pressed.

L4-cue_113
00:10:02.576 --> 00:10:07.426
#The best characteristic of physical law is its universality, and if there’s anything universal

L4-cue_114
00:10:07.426 --> 00:10:09.686
about the thing, it’s the universal expansion

L4-cue_115
00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:13.036
of all the nebulae-so I have no way of defining that.

L4-cue_116
00:10:13.036 --> 00:10:17.476
But if I restrict myself to disregard that matter,

L4-cue_117
00:10:17.476 --> 00:10:21.216
then as far as the other physical laws are known—(and the law

L4-cue_118
00:10:21.216 --> 00:10:24.626
that determines how the thing expands, or, I mean, the cause of it, and so on,

L4-cue_119
00:10:24.626 --> 00:10:27.936
is not known)—if you take only the physical laws that are known,

L4-cue_120
00:10:27.936 --> 00:10:31.516
a delay in time makes no difference.

L4-cue_121
00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.946
#Now, we take some other examples.

L4-cue_122
00:10:33.946 --> 00:10:40.536
Another is a rotation in space, a fixed rotation: if I build a piece of equipment,

L4-cue_123
00:10:40.536 --> 00:10:43.576
and do some experiment with a piece of equipment built here

L4-cue_124
00:10:43.576 --> 00:10:50.406
and then take another one (better translate it so it doesn’t get in the way) here—but turn it

L4-cue_125
00:10:50.406 --> 00:10:54.566
so that all the axes are a different direction, it’ll work the same way.

L4-cue_126
00:10:54.566 --> 00:10:58.526
Again, we have to turn everything that’s relevant: if the thing is a grandfather clock,

L4-cue_127
00:10:58.526 --> 00:11:02.186
and you turn it this way, well, the pendulum would just sit up against the wall of the can;

L4-cue_128
00:11:02.186 --> 00:11:06.916
it won’t work-but if you turn the earth too, as is going on all the time,

L4-cue_129
00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:10.356
it still keeps working all right.

L4-cue_130
00:11:10.356 --> 00:11:15.546
#The mathematical description of this possibility of turning is a rather interesting one,

L4-cue_131
00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:20.976
because to describe what goes on in this situation, we like to use numbers to tell

L4-cue_132
00:11:20.976 --> 00:11:24.016
where something is—they’re called the coordinates of a point.

L4-cue_133
00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:29.896
We use, for instance, sometimes, three numbers to do it: how high it is above some plane,

L4-cue_134
00:11:29.896 --> 00:11:36.166
how far it is in front of me, say (and back is the negative numbers), and how far to the left.

L4-cue_135
00:11:36.166 --> 00:11:37.126
Suppose I did that.

L4-cue_136
00:11:37.126 --> 00:11:39.736
(I’m not going to worry about up and down because for rotations,

L4-cue_137
00:11:39.736 --> 00:11:42.216
I just have to use two of these three.)

L4-cue_138
00:11:42.216 --> 00:11:47.146
Let’s call the distance this way X, in front of me, and Y is how much to the left;

L4-cue_139
00:11:47.146 --> 00:11:51.716
then I can locate anybody by telling how far he is in front, how far to the left.

L4-cue_140
00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:55.036
(Those who come from New York City will know that the street numbers work

L4-cue_141
00:11:55.036 --> 00:12:03.516
that way very neatly—until they began to change the name of 6th Avenue!)

L4-cue_142
00:12:03.516 --> 00:12:10.396
#Now, the mathematical idea about the turning is this:

L4-cue_143
00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:17.336
that if I sit at a somewhat different angle, and make my calculations, then what’s directly

L4-cue_144
00:12:17.336 --> 00:12:20.746
in front of me at distance X is a mixture.

L4-cue_145
00:12:20.746 --> 00:12:25.836
Let’s say there’s a man over here (you), who’s standing this way, and making his analysis,

L4-cue_146
00:12:25.836 --> 00:12:28.236
and me, standing this way, and making my analysis.

L4-cue_147
00:12:28.236 --> 00:12:32.216
When I measure distance X, if I go straight out on X and don’t change to the right

L4-cue_148
00:12:32.216 --> 00:12:36.906
or to the left, you’ll see that that line is a mixture of some of your X-ish business,

L4-cue_149
00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:42.606
and some of the Y. So that the connection, the transformation, is that X gets mixed into X

L4-cue_150
00:12:42.606 --> 00:12:47.746
and Y, and Y gets mixed into Y and X—and the laws of nature shall be so written

L4-cue_151
00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:50.666
that if you make such a mixture and resubstitute it in the equations,

L4-cue_152
00:12:50.666 --> 00:12:55.346
the equations will not change their form—that’s the mathematical way

L4-cue_153
00:12:55.346 --> 00:12:56.726
in which the symmetry appears.

L4-cue_154
00:12:56.726 --> 00:13:00.646
If you write, in mathematical form, the symmetry appears this way: you write the equations

L4-cue_155
00:13:00.646 --> 00:13:03.966
with certain letters, then there’s a way of changing the letters from X

L4-cue_156
00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:09.016
and Y to a different X (X'), and a different Y (Y'), which is some formula in terms

L4-cue_157
00:13:09.016 --> 00:13:13.666
of the old X and Y, and the equations look the same—only you have "primes" (') all over them.

L4-cue_158
00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:18.536
That just means that the man will see the thing behaving in his apparatus the same way

L4-cue_159
00:13:18.536 --> 00:13:21.306
as I see it in mine, which is turned the other way.

L4-cue_160
00:13:21.306 --> 00:13:25.336
#I give another example.

L4-cue_161
00:13:25.336 --> 00:13:31.466
This example is very interesting; it’s a question of uniform velocity in a straight line:

L4-cue_162
00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:36.006
it is believed that the laws of physics are unchanged

L4-cue_163
00:13:36.006 --> 00:13:41.156
under the symmetry—under the operation—of making a uniform velocity in a straight line.

L4-cue_164
00:13:41.156 --> 00:13:43.656
This is called the principle of relativity.

L4-cue_165
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:47.556
If we have, for instance, a spaceship, and we have a little equipment

L4-cue_166
00:13:47.556 --> 00:13:49.996
in it that’s doing something, and we have another equipment down here

L4-cue_167
00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:54.546
on the ground-and the spaceship is going along at a uniform speed-then inside the spaceship,

L4-cue_168
00:13:54.546 --> 00:13:58.096
somebody watching what’s going on can see nothing different

L4-cue_169
00:13:58.096 --> 00:14:00.606
than the man that’s standing still in his apparatus in there.

L4-cue_170
00:14:00.606 --> 00:14:05.006
Of course, if he looks outside, or he bumps into an outside wall, or something like that,

L4-cue_171
00:14:05.006 --> 00:14:09.256
that’s another matter, but insofar as he is moving at a uniform velocity in a straight line,

L4-cue_172
00:14:09.256 --> 00:14:14.146
the laws of physics look the same to him as they do to me, who is not moving.

L4-cue_173
00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:18.046
Since that’s the case, I cannot say who’s moving.

L4-cue_174
00:14:18.046 --> 00:14:22.716
#Now, I insist and emphasize here something before we go any further:

L4-cue_175
00:14:22.716 --> 00:14:26.566
that in all of these transformations and all of these symmetries,

L4-cue_176
00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:30.386
we are not talking about moving the whole universe.

L4-cue_177
00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:34.856
Just like the case of the time, I could imagine I moved all the times in the whole universe-

L4-cue_178
00:14:34.856 --> 00:14:37.806
but that doesn’t make any difference: there’d be no content in the statement

L4-cue_179
00:14:37.806 --> 00:14:40.426
that if I took everything in the whole universe and moved it over,

L4-cue_180
00:14:40.426 --> 00:14:42.686
it would all behave the same way.

L4-cue_181
00:14:42.686 --> 00:14:46.846
#The very remarkable thing is, if I take a piece of apparatus and move it over,

L4-cue_182
00:14:46.846 --> 00:14:50.386
then if I make sure about a lot of conditions, and can include enough apparatus,

L4-cue_183
00:14:50.386 --> 00:14:54.456
I can get a piece of the world, and move it relative to the average of all the rest

L4-cue_184
00:14:54.456 --> 00:14:57.166
of the stars-and it still doesn’t make any difference.

L4-cue_185
00:14:57.166 --> 00:15:00.726
And in this case, it means that someone coasting at a uniform velocity

L4-cue_186
00:15:00.726 --> 00:15:07.676
in a straight line relative to the average of the rest of the nebulae sees no effect:

L4-cue_187
00:15:07.676 --> 00:15:12.286
it is impossible to determine by experiments inside a car without looking out,

L4-cue_188
00:15:12.286 --> 00:15:21.456
by any effects, that you’re moving relative to all the stars, if you want.

L4-cue_189
00:15:21.456 --> 00:15:25.216
#This proposition was first stated by Newton.

L4-cue_190
00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.196
Let’s take his law of gravitation, for instance.

L4-cue_191
00:15:27.196 --> 00:15:33.816
It said that the forces are inversely as a square (so, let’s see, what else, yes),

L4-cue_192
00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:38.656
and that the force produces changes in velocity.

L4-cue_193
00:15:38.656 --> 00:15:43.446
Now, suppose that I watch a moving thing—for instance, I have worked out what happens

L4-cue_194
00:15:43.446 --> 00:15:47.436
when a planet goes around a fixed sun—and now I want to work out what happens

L4-cue_195
00:15:47.436 --> 00:15:49.996
when a planet’s going around a drifting sun.

L4-cue_196
00:15:49.996 --> 00:15:53.856
Well, then, all of the velocities that I had in the first case are different

L4-cue_197
00:15:53.856 --> 00:15:57.046
than in the second case; I just add a constant velocity on.

L4-cue_198
00:15:57.046 --> 00:16:03.126
But the laws are stated in terms of changes in velocity, so that what happens is that the pull

L4-cue_199
00:16:03.126 --> 00:16:06.986
of this planet for this changes this one’s speed—and for the other case,

L4-cue_200
00:16:06.986 --> 00:16:09.126
changes its speed by the same amount.

L4-cue_201
00:16:09.126 --> 00:16:12.536
#So anything that I started with—any initial speed that I started with—it just keeps

L4-cue_202
00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:16.716
on going, and all the changes are accumulated on top of that.

L4-cue_203
00:16:16.716 --> 00:16:20.436
That’s not a very good description, but the net result of the mathematics is

L4-cue_204
00:16:20.436 --> 00:16:26.046
that if you add a constant speed, the laws will be exactly the same—so that we cannot,

L4-cue_205
00:16:26.046 --> 00:16:29.976
by studying the solar system and the way the planets go around the sun,

L4-cue_206
00:16:29.976 --> 00:16:34.286
figure out whether the sun is itself drifting through space: there’s no effect of such a drift

L4-cue_207
00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:38.026
through space on the motion of the planets around the sun according to Newton’s laws.

L4-cue_208
00:16:38.026 --> 00:16:43.246
So that Newton said, "The motion of bodies among themselves is the same in a space,

L4-cue_209
00:16:43.246 --> 00:16:46.346
whether that space is itself at rest relative to fixed stars,

L4-cue_210
00:16:46.346 --> 00:16:51.166
or is moving at a uniform velocity in a straight line."

L4-cue_211
00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.956
#Now, it turns out that as time went on, that new laws were discovered after Newton;

L4-cue_212
00:16:54.956 --> 00:16:59.006
those were the laws of electricity by Maxwell.

L4-cue_213
00:16:59.006 --> 00:17:01.326
One of the consequences of the laws of electricity was

L4-cue_214
00:17:01.326 --> 00:17:04.456
that there should be waves—electromagnetic waves (light, in fact,

L4-cue_215
00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:12.116
is an example)—which should go at 186,000 miles a second—flat.

L4-cue_216
00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:17.066
I mean, by that, 186,000 miles a second come what may.

L4-cue_217
00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:19.246
So then it was easy to tell where rest was,

L4-cue_218
00:17:19.246 --> 00:17:24.566
because a law like "light goes 186,000 miles a second" is certainly not one (or

L4-cue_219
00:17:24.566 --> 00:17:31.716
at first sight is certainly not one) which is quite right,

L4-cue_220
00:17:31.716 --> 00:17:35.476
which will permit one to move and get the same law.

L4-cue_221
00:17:35.476 --> 00:17:39.596
#It’s evident, is it not, that if you’re in a spaceship going 100,000 miles a second

L4-cue_222
00:17:39.596 --> 00:17:44.596
in that direction, and I’m standing still and shoot a light beam at 186,000 miles a second,

L4-cue_223
00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:48.246
you look out the window-or if I shoot the beam through a little hole through your ship,

L4-cue_224
00:17:48.246 --> 00:17:51.176
as it goes through your ship, since you’re going 100,000,

L4-cue_225
00:17:51.176 --> 00:17:54.096
and the light’s going 186,000—light is only going to look

L4-cue_226
00:17:54.096 --> 00:17:57.476
like it’s passing you at 86,000 miles a second.

L4-cue_227
00:17:57.476 --> 00:18:03.826
#But if you do the experiment, it looks like it’s going 186,000 miles past you, and past me!

L4-cue_228
00:18:03.826 --> 00:18:12.396
The facts of nature are not so easy to understand, and the fact of the experiment was

L4-cue_229
00:18:12.396 --> 00:18:16.366
so obviously counter to common sense, that there are some people

L4-cue_230
00:18:16.366 --> 00:18:20.096
who still don’t believe the result.

L4-cue_231
00:18:20.096 --> 00:18:23.716
But experimentally, time after time, experiments indicated

L4-cue_232
00:18:23.716 --> 00:18:30.126
that the speed is 186,000 miles a second, no matter how fast you’re moving.

L4-cue_233
00:18:30.126 --> 00:18:34.596
#And now the question, how could that be?

L4-cue_234
00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:44.556
Poincaré proposed that one take as one of the principles of nature that the principles

L4-cue_235
00:18:44.556 --> 00:18:48.496
of Maxwell’s equations are right, and that the mathematical changes needed

L4-cue_236
00:18:48.496 --> 00:18:54.366
to compare a system moving and a system standing still that come in that case should be—well,

L4-cue_237
00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:59.596
that’s—I’m making it sound too complicated; I’ll come back and change the way of stating it:

L4-cue_238
00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:02.256
#Einstein realized, and Poincaré, too (and it’s hard

L4-cue_239
00:19:02.256 --> 00:19:06.386
to get the history right while you’re trying to explain the idea at the same time),

L4-cue_240
00:19:06.386 --> 00:19:11.456
that the only possible way in which a person moving

L4-cue_241
00:19:11.456 --> 00:19:16.166
and a person standing still could measure the speed to be the same was that their sense

L4-cue_242
00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:20.616
of time and their sense of space are not the same—that the ticking clocks inside the

L4-cue_243
00:19:20.616 --> 00:19:24.856
spaceship are ticking at a different speed than they are on the ground, and so forth.

L4-cue_244
00:19:24.856 --> 00:19:27.506
Of course, you say, "Yeah, but if the clock is ticking, I look at the clock

L4-cue_245
00:19:27.506 --> 00:19:29.316
in the spaceship, but I see it’s going slow."

L4-cue_246
00:19:29.316 --> 00:19:33.356
"No, no: your brain is going slow too!"

L4-cue_247
00:19:33.356 --> 00:19:38.296
#So by making sure that everything went just so inside the spaceship, it was possible to cook

L4-cue_248
00:19:38.296 --> 00:19:40.656
up a system by which in the spaceship it would look

L4-cue_249
00:19:40.656 --> 00:19:45.956
like 186,000 spaceship miles per spaceship second—whereas it looks

L4-cue_250
00:19:45.956 --> 00:19:48.966
like 186,000 my miles in my seconds at the same thing.

L4-cue_251
00:19:48.966 --> 00:19:55.426
#It was a very ingenious thing to be able to do; it turns out, remarkably enough, to be possible.

L4-cue_252
00:19:55.426 --> 00:19:58.626
I mentioned already one of the consequences of this principle

L4-cue_253
00:19:58.626 --> 00:20:04.336
of relativity-that you cannot tell how fast you’re moving in a straight line:

L4-cue_254
00:20:04.336 --> 00:20:12.826
in which we had two cars, and there was an event that happened at each end

L4-cue_255
00:20:12.826 --> 00:20:15.706
of this car-a man was standing in the middle of the car, and there was an event that happened

L4-cue_256
00:20:15.706 --> 00:20:21.026
at each end of this car at a certain instant—which this man claimed was the same time

L4-cue_257
00:20:21.026 --> 00:20:26.186
(because, standing in the middle of the car, he saw the light from both of these things

L4-cue_258
00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:29.786
at the same time), whereas a man in another car, who happened to be moving this way

L4-cue_259
00:20:29.786 --> 00:20:34.586
with a velocity, saw these same two events not at the same time,

L4-cue_260
00:20:34.586 --> 00:20:39.536
but in fact saw the one here first, because the light reached him before the light

L4-cue_261
00:20:39.536 --> 00:20:42.096
from here, because he was moving forward.

L4-cue_262
00:20:42.096 --> 00:20:46.546
So, you see, that one of the consequences of the principle of symmetry for uniform velocity

L4-cue_263
00:20:46.546 --> 00:20:50.236
in a straight line (that symmetry means you can’t tell who’s right),

L4-cue_264
00:20:50.236 --> 00:20:54.256
is that when someone talks about something—like, when I talk about everything that’s happening

L4-cue_265
00:20:54.256 --> 00:20:57.976
in the world now-that doesn’t mean anything.

L4-cue_266
00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:05.036
If you’re moving along at a uniform velocity in a straight line, everything that happens at now—

L4-cue_267
00:21:05.036 --> 00:21:09.426
simultaneous—is not the same events as my now, even though we’re passing each other,

L4-cue_268
00:21:09.426 --> 00:21:14.876
and our instant here is the same, but somewhere else—we cannot agree what now means

L4-cue_269
00:21:14.876 --> 00:21:17.296
at a distance.

L4-cue_270
00:21:17.296 --> 00:21:20.966
#So this means a profound transformation of our ideas of space and time,

L4-cue_271
00:21:20.966 --> 00:21:28.786
in order to maintain this principle that uniform velocity in a straight line cannot be detected.

L4-cue_272
00:21:28.786 --> 00:21:35.126
Actually, what’s happening here is that the time—from one point of view,

L4-cue_273
00:21:35.126 --> 00:21:38.516
two things that are simultaneous, seem, from another point of view,

L4-cue_274
00:21:38.516 --> 00:21:41.086
to be not at the same time, provided they’re not

L4-cue_275
00:21:41.086 --> 00:21:44.116
at the same place—that they’re far apart in distance.

L4-cue_276
00:21:44.116 --> 00:21:49.996
That’s very much like my X and Y: two things which seem to me to be

L4-cue_277
00:21:49.996 --> 00:21:56.606
at the same horizontal—well, let’s say the same distance in front—zero distance in front, will,

L4-cue_278
00:21:56.606 --> 00:22:01.706
from somebody this way—he’ll say, "One of them is in front of me, and one is in back."

L4-cue_279
00:22:01.706 --> 00:22:03.546
See, consider, from my point of view,

L4-cue_280
00:22:03.546 --> 00:22:06.526
they’re both even with me—that wall and that wall—is even with me.

L4-cue_281
00:22:06.526 --> 00:22:09.676
#But if I stand and turn like this, and look at the same pair of walls

L4-cue_282
00:22:09.676 --> 00:22:14.766
but from a different point of view, that one’s in front of me, and that one’s behind.

L4-cue_283
00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:19.686
And so it is that the two events, which from one point of view seem to be at the same time,

L4-cue_284
00:22:19.686 --> 00:22:22.376
from the other point of view seem to be at different times.

L4-cue_285
00:22:22.376 --> 00:22:27.076
And the generalization of the two—dimensional rotation that I’m talking about into space

L4-cue_286
00:22:27.076 --> 00:22:32.976
and time was made, so that the time was added to the space to make a four—dimensional world.

L4-cue_287
00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:38.696
#And it’s not merely an artificial addition to say, "Well, we add time to space, because,

L4-cue_288
00:22:38.696 --> 00:22:41.226
as is seen in most of the popular books,

L4-cue_289
00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:44.646
you cannot only locate a point, but you have to say when."

L4-cue_290
00:22:44.646 --> 00:22:50.586
That’s all true, but that doesn’t make it real space; that just puts two things together.

L4-cue_291
00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:54.386
Real space has, in a sense, the characteristic that ...

L4-cue_292
00:22:54.386 --> 00:22:57.926
it’s possible to look at it from a different point of view,

L4-cue_293
00:22:57.926 --> 00:23:02.256
that it has an existence that’s independent of the particular point of view.

L4-cue_294
00:23:02.256 --> 00:23:07.106
There’s a commonness—there’s a certain amount of time that can get mixed up with a certain amount

L4-cue_295
00:23:07.106 --> 00:23:11.726
of space, so that space and time must be completely interlocked.

L4-cue_296
00:23:11.726 --> 00:23:17.766
#After this discovery, Minkowski said, "Space of itself, and time of itself,

L4-cue_297
00:23:17.766 --> 00:23:23.686
shall sink into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two shall survive."

L4-cue_298
00:23:23.686 --> 00:23:29.106
I bring this particular example up in such detail because it is really the beginning

L4-cue_299
00:23:29.106 --> 00:23:31.656
of the study of symmetries and physical laws.

L4-cue_300
00:23:31.656 --> 00:23:35.886
It was Poincaré’s suggestion to make this analysis of what you can do

L4-cue_301
00:23:35.886 --> 00:23:37.596
to the equations and leave them alone.

L4-cue_302
00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:43.026
It was Poincaré’s attitude to pay attention to the symmetries of physical laws:

L4-cue_303
00:23:43.026 --> 00:23:48.646
the symmetries of translation in space, delay in time, and so on, were not very deep,

L4-cue_304
00:23:48.646 --> 00:23:54.126
but the symmetry of uniform velocity in a straight line is very interesting,

L4-cue_305
00:23:54.126 --> 00:23:56.226
and has all kinds of consequences.

L4-cue_306
00:23:56.226 --> 00:24:02.856
#Furthermore, these consequences were extendable into laws that we did not know:

L4-cue_307
00:24:02.856 --> 00:24:05.966
by guessing that this principle is true with the disintegration

L4-cue_308
00:24:05.966 --> 00:24:09.496
of a mu meson (we don’t know why the mu meson disintegrates in the first place),

L4-cue_309
00:24:09.496 --> 00:24:14.196
we can tell a lot about it by the proposition that we can’t use mu mesons

L4-cue_310
00:24:14.196 --> 00:24:17.796
to tell how fast we’re going in the spaceship either—and that tells us something, at least,

L4-cue_311
00:24:17.796 --> 00:24:20.666
about the mu meson disintegrations.

L4-cue_312
00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:24.316
#There are many other symmetries of somewhat—some of are of different kinds.

L4-cue_313
00:24:24.316 --> 00:24:31.376
#I just mentioned a—another one is that you can replace one atom by another of the same kind,

L4-cue_314
00:24:31.376 --> 00:24:35.046
and it makes no difference to any phenomenon.

L4-cue_315
00:24:35.046 --> 00:24:39.786
Now you say, "Yeah, what do you mean by the same kind?"—"I mean one where you replace it

L4-cue_316
00:24:39.786 --> 00:24:42.826
by the other it doesn’t make any difference."

L4-cue_317
00:24:42.826 --> 00:24:46.916
#It looks like physicists are always talking nonsense in a way, doesn’t it?

L4-cue_318
00:24:46.916 --> 00:24:49.736
Because there are many different kinds, and if you replace one [atom] by one

L4-cue_319
00:24:49.736 --> 00:24:52.806
of the different kind, it makes a difference, but if you replace one by the same kind,

L4-cue_320
00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:55.546
it doesn’t make any difference—and that just seems like a circular definition.

L4-cue_321
00:24:55.546 --> 00:25:01.996
But the meaning of the thing is, that there are atoms of the same kind, that it is possible

L4-cue_322
00:25:01.996 --> 00:25:07.146
to find groups, classes of atoms, that you can replace one by another of the same kind,

L4-cue_323
00:25:07.146 --> 00:25:09.266
and it doesn’t make any difference—there are such things.

L4-cue_324
00:25:09.266 --> 00:25:13.466
#Since the number of atoms in any little tiny piece of material is one followed

L4-cue_325
00:25:13.466 --> 00:25:17.446
by 23 naughts [zeros] or so, it’s very important

L4-cue_326
00:25:17.446 --> 00:25:21.016
that they are the same—that they’re not all different kinds.

L4-cue_327
00:25:21.016 --> 00:25:24.406
It’s really very interesting that we can classify them into a limited number

L4-cue_328
00:25:24.406 --> 00:25:28.966
of a few hundred atoms, so that the statement that we can replace one atom by another

L4-cue_329
00:25:28.966 --> 00:25:32.756
of the same kind has a very great amount of content.

L4-cue_330
00:25:32.756 --> 00:25:35.636
It has the greatest amount of content in quantum mechanics,

L4-cue_331
00:25:35.636 --> 00:25:39.576
and it is impossible for me to explain how, partly.

L4-cue_332
00:25:39.576 --> 00:25:44.956
But only partly, because this is an audience that is mathematically untrained.

L4-cue_333
00:25:44.956 --> 00:25:47.106
It’s quite subtle, anyhow.

L4-cue_334
00:25:47.106 --> 00:25:49.936
But in quantum mechanics the proposition that you can replace one atom

L4-cue_335
00:25:49.936 --> 00:25:56.276
by the same kind has marvelous consequences that produces peculiar phenomena—in liquid helium,

L4-cue_336
00:25:56.276 --> 00:26:01.496
the liquid that flows through pipes without any resistance, just coasts on forever;

L4-cue_337
00:26:01.496 --> 00:26:07.976
it has all kinds of consequences—in fact, it’s the origin of the whole periodic table

L4-cue_338
00:26:07.976 --> 00:26:15.766
of the elements, and the force that keeps me from going through the floor.

L4-cue_339
00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:17.436
But I can’t go into that particular thing, but I want

L4-cue_340
00:26:17.436 --> 00:26:21.326
to emphasize the importance of looking at these principles.

L4-cue_341
00:26:21.326 --> 00:26:25.616
#By this time, you’re probably convinced that all the laws of physics are symmetric under any kind

L4-cue_342
00:26:25.616 --> 00:26:30.926
of change whatsoever, so I have to give a few ones that don’t work.

L4-cue_343
00:26:30.926 --> 00:26:37.296
First one, change of scale: it is not true that if you build an apparatus, and come over here

L4-cue_344
00:26:37.296 --> 00:26:41.496
and build one twice as big—every part made exactly the same, same kind of stuff but twice

L4-cue_345
00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:44.226
as big-that it will work exactly the same way.

L4-cue_346
00:26:44.226 --> 00:26:46.956
You who are familiar with atoms are aware of this fact,

L4-cue_347
00:26:46.956 --> 00:26:51.176
because if I made it 10 billion times smaller, I would only have five atoms

L4-cue_348
00:26:51.176 --> 00:26:54.366
in it-and I can’t make a machine tool, which this thing is,

L4-cue_349
00:26:54.366 --> 00:26:58.616
with screw threads, and so on, out of five atoms.

L4-cue_350
00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:02.166
#So it’s perfectly obvious, if we go far enough, that we can’t change the scale.

L4-cue_351
00:27:02.166 --> 00:27:06.346
But even before the complete awareness of the atomic picture was developed,

L4-cue_352
00:27:06.346 --> 00:27:08.836
it became apparent that this law isn’t right.

L4-cue_353
00:27:08.836 --> 00:27:12.966
You’ve probably seen in the newspapers from time to time somebody who’s made a cathedral

L4-cue_354
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:18.856
with matchsticks-several floors, and beautifully delicate, and everything just-more Gothic

L4-cue_355
00:27:18.856 --> 00:27:22.296
than any Gothic cathedral has ever been, more delicate.

L4-cue_356
00:27:22.296 --> 00:27:28.556
Why don’t we build big ones like that, with great logs, with the same degree of ginger cake,

L4-cue_357
00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:30.536
the same enormous degree of detail?

L4-cue_358
00:27:30.536 --> 00:27:35.816
The answer is, if we did, it would be so high, and so heavy, it would collapse.

L4-cue_359
00:27:35.816 --> 00:27:38.946
You say, "Yeah, but you forgot when you’re comparing two things,

L4-cue_360
00:27:38.946 --> 00:27:42.676
you must change everything that’s in the system: the little cathedral made

L4-cue_361
00:27:42.676 --> 00:27:46.716
with matchsticks is attracted to the earth, so to make the comparison,

L4-cue_362
00:27:46.716 --> 00:27:50.836
I should make the big cathedral, like, attract it to an even bigger earth!"

L4-cue_363
00:27:50.836 --> 00:27:53.666
Too bad: a bigger earth would attract it even more,

L4-cue_364
00:27:53.666 --> 00:27:55.566
and the sticks would break even more surely."

L4-cue_365
00:27:55.566 --> 00:28:02.436
#This fact, that the laws of physics were [not] unchanged

L4-cue_366
00:28:02.436 --> 00:28:06.026
under scale was first discovered by Galileo.

L4-cue_367
00:28:06.026 --> 00:28:12.886
He argued, in discussing the strength of rods and bones—he argued that if you need a bone

L4-cue_368
00:28:12.886 --> 00:28:16.806
for a bigger animal (say, an animal is twice as high, wide, and thick),

L4-cue_369
00:28:16.806 --> 00:28:22.296
you need eight times the weight—so you need a bone that can hold the strength eight times.

L4-cue_370
00:28:22.296 --> 00:28:27.056
But what a bone can hold depends on its cross section, and if you made the bone twice as big,

L4-cue_371
00:28:27.056 --> 00:28:29.686
it would only have four times the cross section, and would only be able

L4-cue_372
00:28:29.686 --> 00:28:31.126
to support four times the weight.

L4-cue_373
00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:37.696
#In Galileo’s book called Two New Sciences, you’ll see pictures of imaginary bones

L4-cue_374
00:28:37.696 --> 00:28:41.336
of enormous dogs, way out of proportion.

L4-cue_375
00:28:41.336 --> 00:28:44.266
Galileo felt that the discovery—I suppose he felt, I don’t know,

L4-cue_376
00:28:44.266 --> 00:28:47.786
but the discovery-of the fact that the laws of nature are not unchanged on the change

L4-cue_377
00:28:47.786 --> 00:28:51.856
of scale was as important as his laws of motion, because they’re both put together

L4-cue_378
00:28:51.856 --> 00:28:56.796
in a tome called Two New Sciences.

L4-cue_379
00:28:56.796 --> 00:29:02.916
#Now, I go on to another example of something that is not a symmetry law, and that is,

L4-cue_380
00:29:02.916 --> 00:29:08.136
it is not true that if you’re spinning at a uniform angular speed in a spaceship,

L4-cue_381
00:29:08.136 --> 00:29:12.336
you can’t tell if you’re going around; you can: everything gets thrown to the walls.

L4-cue_382
00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:16.616
I was going to say you get dizzy, but that soon passes.

L4-cue_383
00:29:16.616 --> 00:29:21.666
There are a lot of effects, however: things do get thrown to the walls

L4-cue_384
00:29:21.666 --> 00:29:24.546
from the centrifugal force, or however you wish to describe it.

L4-cue_385
00:29:24.546 --> 00:29:31.256
(I hope that there’s no teachers of freshman physics here to correct me!)

L4-cue_386
00:29:31.256 --> 00:29:38.566
But it is possible to tell that the earth is rotating by a pendulum, or by a gyroscope,

L4-cue_387
00:29:38.566 --> 00:29:42.376
and you’re probably aware, in various observatories and museums, and so on,

L4-cue_388
00:29:42.376 --> 00:29:46.806
of these Foucault pendulums that prove the earth is rotating, without looking at the stars.

L4-cue_389
00:29:46.806 --> 00:29:51.416
So it is possible to tell that we are going around at a uniform angular velocity

L4-cue_390
00:29:51.416 --> 00:29:56.256
on the earth without looking outside, because the laws of physics are not unchanged by that.

L4-cue_391
00:29:56.256 --> 00:30:05.266
Many people have proposed that really you’re rotating relative to the galaxies, see,

L4-cue_392
00:30:05.266 --> 00:30:09.876
and if you would turn the galaxies, too, it wouldn’t make any difference.

L4-cue_393
00:30:09.876 --> 00:30:12.856
#Well, I don’t know what would happen if you would turn the whole universe, and we have,

L4-cue_394
00:30:12.856 --> 00:30:19.446
at the moment, no way to tell—nor, at the moment, do we have a theory

L4-cue_395
00:30:19.446 --> 00:30:25.116
which describes the influence of a galaxy on things here so that it comes out of this theory

L4-cue_396
00:30:25.116 --> 00:30:28.816
in a straightforward way (not by cheating, or forcing, or anything like that,

L4-cue_397
00:30:28.816 --> 00:30:33.646
[but] in a straightforward way) that the inertia for rotation—that the effects of rotation,

L4-cue_398
00:30:33.646 --> 00:30:37.236
the fact that a spinning bucket of water has a shape into a surface

L4-cue_399
00:30:37.236 --> 00:30:41.836
like this-that this is a result of a force from the objects around.

L4-cue_400
00:30:41.836 --> 00:30:44.596
That’s not known to be the case.

L4-cue_401
00:30:44.596 --> 00:30:47.756
That this should be the case was called Mach’s principle—but

L4-cue_402
00:30:47.756 --> 00:30:51.206
that it is the case has not yet been demonstrated.

L4-cue_403
00:30:51.206 --> 00:30:59.376
#But the real question is—I mean, the more direct, experimental question is—that

L4-cue_404
00:30:59.376 --> 00:31:03.686
if we’re rotating at a uniform velocity relative to the nebulae, do we see an effect?

L4-cue_405
00:31:03.686 --> 00:31:04.646
The answer is yes.

L4-cue_406
00:31:04.646 --> 00:31:08.246
If we’re moving in a spaceship at a uniform velocity in a straight line relative

L4-cue_407
00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:09.966
to the nebulae, do we see an effect?

L4-cue_408
00:31:09.966 --> 00:31:11.986
The answer is no—two different things.

L4-cue_409
00:31:11.986 --> 00:31:16.856
So, don’t say all motion is relative; that’s not the content of relativity.

L4-cue_410
00:31:16.856 --> 00:31:21.016
Relativity says that uniform velocity in a straight line,

L4-cue_411
00:31:21.016 --> 00:31:27.526
relative to the nebulae, is undetectable.

L4-cue_412
00:31:27.526 --> 00:31:32.326
#Now the next symmetry law that I would like to discuss is an interesting one,

L4-cue_413
00:31:32.326 --> 00:31:37.016
because it has an interesting history, and that’s the question of reflection in space.

L4-cue_414
00:31:37.016 --> 00:31:42.336
If I build a piece of apparatus, let’s say a clock, and then I come over here,

L4-cue_415
00:31:42.336 --> 00:31:47.386
and I build another clock exactly the same way, but like this one looks in the mirror.

L4-cue_416
00:31:47.386 --> 00:31:51.516
I don’t mean I look at this one in a mirror only; I mean I build another clock

L4-cue_417
00:31:51.516 --> 00:31:57.816
which is exact built, to be a "Chinese copy" of what the other one looks like in a mirror.

L4-cue_418
00:31:57.816 --> 00:32:01.906
In other words, I have the number 2 painted neatly on the dial here;

L4-cue_419
00:32:01.906 --> 00:32:04.776
then I paint the number 2 the other way around over here.

L4-cue_420
00:32:04.776 --> 00:32:12.696
(I got an opportunity to make a drawing: 2 on one part, [backwards] 2 on the other part.)

L4-cue_421
00:32:12.696 --> 00:32:18.126
Each spring which is wound one way in one part, is wound in the corresponding opposite way

L4-cue_422
00:32:18.126 --> 00:32:23.436
in the other clock; they match each other like two gloves, right and left.

L4-cue_423
00:32:23.436 --> 00:32:27.836
Now we wind up the two clocks; we set them in corresponding positions (I was going

L4-cue_424
00:32:27.836 --> 00:32:32.506
to say the same, but we set them to the mirrored positions) and we let them tick.

L4-cue_425
00:32:32.506 --> 00:32:36.176
#Question: will they always agree with each other?

L4-cue_426
00:32:36.176 --> 00:32:43.466
Will all the machinery of the clock go in the mirror image of the other one?

L4-cue_427
00:32:43.466 --> 00:32:47.856
I don’t know what you would guess about that; you’d probably guess it’s true,

L4-cue_428
00:32:47.856 --> 00:32:54.426
and most people did guess it was true.

L4-cue_429
00:32:54.426 --> 00:33:01.316
Of course, we’re not talking about geography; we can distinguish right and left by geography:

L4-cue_430
00:33:01.316 --> 00:33:06.736
we can say if we stand in Florida and look at New York, the ocean is on the right-and

L4-cue_431
00:33:06.736 --> 00:33:08.546
that distinguishes right and left ...

L4-cue_432
00:33:08.546 --> 00:33:15.276
and if the clock involved the water of the sea, and New York and so on, then it wouldn’t work

L4-cue_433
00:33:15.276 --> 00:33:19.306
if you built it the other way because its ticker wouldn’t get in the water.

L4-cue_434
00:33:19.306 --> 00:33:23.096
#But what we have to imagine, of course, is that the geography of the earth is turned around,

L4-cue_435
00:33:23.096 --> 00:33:26.376
too, on the other clock—anything that’s involved must be turned around.

L4-cue_436
00:33:26.376 --> 00:33:31.176
Nor are we interested in history: for example, if you pick up a screw in a machine shop,

L4-cue_437
00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:34.836
the chances are it’s right—hand thread, and you might argue the other clock isn’t going

L4-cue_438
00:33:34.836 --> 00:33:36.266
to be the same as this one, because it’s harder

L4-cue_439
00:33:36.266 --> 00:33:40.836
to get the screws—but that’s just a question of what kind of things we make.

L4-cue_440
00:33:40.836 --> 00:33:45.576
So that altogether, the first guess is, that it doesn’t make any difference.

L4-cue_441
00:33:45.576 --> 00:33:48.636
#It turns out that the laws of gravitation are

L4-cue_442
00:33:48.636 --> 00:33:52.426
such that it wouldn’t make any difference, if it worked by gravity.

L4-cue_443
00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:55.926
The laws of electricity and magnetism are such that if, in addition, it had electric

L4-cue_444
00:33:55.926 --> 00:34:00.396
and magnetic guts (currents and wires and whatnot),

L4-cue_445
00:34:00.396 --> 00:34:03.516
it would still-the corresponding clock would run the same.

L4-cue_446
00:34:03.516 --> 00:34:08.926
And if the clock involved nuclear reactions—ordinary nuclear reactions—to make it

L4-cue_447
00:34:08.926 --> 00:34:18.426
run, it wouldn’t make any difference either, but it does make a little bit of difference;

L4-cue_448
00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:20.946
I’ll come to what makes a difference in a minute.

L4-cue_449
00:34:20.946 --> 00:34:25.346
#But the first possibility (it might suggest itself if you know anything much),

L4-cue_450
00:34:25.346 --> 00:34:30.446
you may have heard that it’s possible to measure the concentration of sugar in water

L4-cue_451
00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:32.786
by putting polarized light through the water.

L4-cue_452
00:34:32.786 --> 00:34:36.596
If you put the piece of Polaroid that lets light through in a certain axis

L4-cue_453
00:34:36.596 --> 00:34:38.076
through the water, then you’ll find ...

L4-cue_454
00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:41.736
when you watch the light as it goes through deeper and deeper sugarwater,

L4-cue_455
00:34:41.736 --> 00:34:46.036
you have to turn the Polaroid—another piece of Polaroid at the other end of the water—more

L4-cue_456
00:34:46.036 --> 00:34:49.296
and more to the right, as the stuff goes through.

L4-cue_457
00:34:49.296 --> 00:34:53.366
(Maybe it’s to the left; I can’t remember, but let’s say to the right,

L4-cue_458
00:34:53.366 --> 00:34:55.996
as you go through deeper, deeper solution.)

L4-cue_459
00:34:55.996 --> 00:34:58.406
And if you make the light go the other way through the solution,

L4-cue_460
00:34:58.406 --> 00:35:02.616
it’s still to the right—so there’s a right—hand way; there’s a difference for right or left.

L4-cue_461
00:35:02.616 --> 00:35:07.056
#So if we put sugarwater in the clocks, and light, then if we put, say,

L4-cue_462
00:35:07.056 --> 00:35:11.126
in one tank of [sugar] water and make the light go through, and turn, and put the Polaroid

L4-cue_463
00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:14.816
so it can just get through, and make the corresponding image on the other side,

L4-cue_464
00:35:14.816 --> 00:35:15.996
hoping the light will turn this way,

L4-cue_465
00:35:15.996 --> 00:35:18.746
it won’t-it’ll turn the other way, and it won’t go through right.

L4-cue_466
00:35:18.746 --> 00:35:25.506
So by using sugarwater, our two clocks can be made differently.

L4-cue_467
00:35:25.506 --> 00:35:28.846
So it’s a very remarkable fact.

L4-cue_468
00:35:28.846 --> 00:35:30.386
#It isn’t true, therefore, at first [glance],

L4-cue_469
00:35:30.386 --> 00:35:37.636
that the two clocks will be—that the physical laws are symmetric for reflections.

L4-cue_470
00:35:37.636 --> 00:35:40.006
However, it’s possible to make sugar in the laboratory.

L4-cue_471
00:35:40.006 --> 00:35:42.386
The sugar that we got that time might have been from sugar beets,

L4-cue_472
00:35:42.386 --> 00:35:46.676
but sugar isn’t a complicated molecule, and it’s possible to make sugar in the laboratory (out

L4-cue_473
00:35:46.676 --> 00:35:50.236
of carbon dioxide and water, and going through lots and lots of stages

L4-cue_474
00:35:50.236 --> 00:35:51.846
in between), and make artificial sugar.

L4-cue_475
00:35:51.846 --> 00:35:53.936
When you put the artificial sugar in there,

L4-cue_476
00:35:53.936 --> 00:35:56.496
which is chemically (and we measure it) every way it seems

L4-cue_477
00:35:56.496 --> 00:36:00.596
to be the same, it doesn’t turn the light.

L4-cue_478
00:36:00.596 --> 00:36:06.866
#Then if you put bacteria in the sugarwater, bacteria eat the sugar—and

L4-cue_479
00:36:06.866 --> 00:36:10.896
when you let the bacteria eat the sugar, and then try with what’s left, it turns out: first,

L4-cue_480
00:36:10.896 --> 00:36:15.816
they only eat half the sugar—[half of] the artificial sugar; second, when you’re all done,

L4-cue_481
00:36:15.816 --> 00:36:19.716
it’s turned to the left, the stuff that’s left.

L4-cue_482
00:36:19.716 --> 00:36:24.166
#Now, you find the explanation to all this is the following:

L4-cue_483
00:36:24.166 --> 00:36:29.696
that sugar is a complicated molecule—a set of balls (atoms) in some complicated arrangement.

L4-cue_484
00:36:29.696 --> 00:36:36.146
If you make exactly the same arrangement, but left as right (like,

L4-cue_485
00:36:36.146 --> 00:36:39.666
if the arrangement is complicated like this, then you make one the same way),

L4-cue_486
00:36:39.666 --> 00:36:46.526
then every distance between every pair of atoms is the same in one as in the other;

L4-cue_487
00:36:46.526 --> 00:36:51.536
the energy of the molecules is exactly the same—for all chemical phenomena not involving

L4-cue_488
00:36:51.536 --> 00:36:54.586
light, they’re the same.

L4-cue_489
00:36:54.586 --> 00:37:00.996
But living creatures find a difference: the bacteria eat one kind, and not the other.

L4-cue_490
00:37:00.996 --> 00:37:03.376
The sugar that comes from sugar beets is only one kind,

L4-cue_491
00:37:03.376 --> 00:37:09.436
all left—hand molecules—or right—hand, [I should say]—so it turns the light one way.

L4-cue_492
00:37:09.436 --> 00:37:11.886
The bacteria can only eat that kind of molecule.

L4-cue_493
00:37:11.886 --> 00:37:14.336
#When we manufacture the sugar from substances

L4-cue_494
00:37:14.336 --> 00:37:20.406
which themselves are not asymmetrical (simple gasses), we make both kinds, in equal number.

L4-cue_495
00:37:20.406 --> 00:37:25.126
Then, if we let the bacteria eat, they’ll eat the kind they can eat,

L4-cue_496
00:37:25.126 --> 00:37:28.286
and the other is left—and that’s why it comes out the other way.

L4-cue_497
00:37:28.286 --> 00:37:31.486
It’s possible to separate the two by looking through magnifying glasses

L4-cue_498
00:37:31.486 --> 00:37:33.316
at the crystals, and separating them, ...

L4-cue_499
00:37:33.316 --> 00:37:35.506
as Pasteur discovered, ...

L4-cue_500
00:37:35.506 --> 00:37:39.386
so that I can definitely show that all this makes sense.

L4-cue_501
00:37:39.386 --> 00:37:42.406
And even our artificial sugar, then, we can separate ourselves;

L4-cue_502
00:37:42.406 --> 00:37:44.876
we don’t have to wait for the bacteria.

L4-cue_503
00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:47.046
#But the interesting thing is that the bacteria can do this.

L4-cue_504
00:37:47.046 --> 00:37:51.196
Does that mean that the living processes don’t obey the same laws of chemistry, and so on?

L4-cue_505
00:37:51.196 --> 00:37:52.506
Apparently not.

L4-cue_506
00:37:52.506 --> 00:37:56.926
It seems that in the living creatures there are many, many complicated molecules,

L4-cue_507
00:37:56.926 --> 00:37:58.906
and they all have a kind of thread to them.

L4-cue_508
00:37:58.906 --> 00:38:02.566
One of the most characteristic molecules in living creatures are proteins,

L4-cue_509
00:38:02.566 --> 00:38:06.086
and it takes a little while to explain the details, but let’s put it very simply,

L4-cue_510
00:38:06.086 --> 00:38:10.496
they have a corkscrew property and they go, let’s say, to the right.

L4-cue_511
00:38:10.496 --> 00:38:14.516
#Now, as far as we can tell, chemically, we could make this,

L4-cue_512
00:38:14.516 --> 00:38:16.106
chemically, the same thing to the left.

L4-cue_513
00:38:16.106 --> 00:38:18.316
It would not function biologically, because it wouldn’t,

L4-cue_514
00:38:18.316 --> 00:38:20.626
when it met the other proteins, fit the same way.

L4-cue_515
00:38:20.626 --> 00:38:23.666
That is, a left—hand thread’ll fit a left—hand thread but a left

L4-cue_516
00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:26.106
and right don’t fit very well the same way.

L4-cue_517
00:38:26.106 --> 00:38:28.666
So the bacteria having a left—hand thread

L4-cue_518
00:38:28.666 --> 00:38:33.396
in the chemical inside can distinguish the left and right sugar.

L4-cue_519
00:38:33.396 --> 00:38:35.196
#How did they get that way?

L4-cue_520
00:38:35.196 --> 00:38:38.606
Physics and chemistry cannot distinguish the molecules;

L4-cue_521
00:38:38.606 --> 00:38:42.626
it can only make both kinds—but biology can.

L4-cue_522
00:38:42.626 --> 00:38:46.896
It’s easy to believe that the explanation is, that long, long ago,

L4-cue_523
00:38:46.896 --> 00:38:51.456
when the life processes first began, some accidental molecule got started

L4-cue_524
00:38:51.456 --> 00:38:56.786
and propagated itself by reproducing itself, and so on, until, after many, many years,

L4-cue_525
00:38:56.786 --> 00:39:00.106
these funny-looking blobs with the prongs sticking out yak

L4-cue_526
00:39:00.106 --> 00:39:06.276
at each other-but they are nothing but the offspring of the first few molecules,

L4-cue_527
00:39:06.276 --> 00:39:09.176
and it’s an accident of the first few molecules that it happened

L4-cue_528
00:39:09.176 --> 00:39:10.596
to form one way instead of the other.

L4-cue_529
00:39:10.596 --> 00:39:16.706
#It has to be one or the other, so the thing that reproduces itself is either left or right,

L4-cue_530
00:39:16.706 --> 00:39:19.836
and then it goes on and propagates this on and on.

L4-cue_531
00:39:19.836 --> 00:39:23.846
It’s much like the screws in the machine shop: we use right—hand thread screws

L4-cue_532
00:39:23.846 --> 00:39:26.796
to make new right—hand thread screws, and so on.

L4-cue_533
00:39:26.796 --> 00:39:34.626
So this is probably one of the deepest demonstrations—the fact

L4-cue_534
00:39:34.626 --> 00:39:38.986
that the protein molecules are exactly the same in all life, they all have exactly the same kind

L4-cue_535
00:39:38.986 --> 00:39:46.086
of thread-is probably one of the deepest demonstrations of the uniformity of the ancestry

L4-cue_536
00:39:46.086 --> 00:39:55.996
of life, the common ancestry of all life—back, in fact, to the completely molecular level.

L4-cue_537
00:39:55.996 --> 00:40:01.826
Now, in order to test better this question about whether the laws of physics are same right

L4-cue_538
00:40:01.826 --> 00:40:04.576
and left, we can put the problem to ourselves this way.

L4-cue_539
00:40:04.576 --> 00:40:09.586
#Suppose that we were in telephone conversation with a Martian or an Arcturian, or something.

L4-cue_540
00:40:09.586 --> 00:40:14.836
We don’t know where he is and we would like to describe things to him.

L4-cue_541
00:40:14.836 --> 00:40:16.406
We want to tell him about things.

L4-cue_542
00:40:16.406 --> 00:40:18.306
You say, so how’s he going to understand the words, well,

L4-cue_543
00:40:18.306 --> 00:40:21.396
that’s been studied very much by Professor Morrison here.

L4-cue_544
00:40:21.396 --> 00:40:25.406
He has pointed out that one way would be to start out and say tick tick two,

L4-cue_545
00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:29.326
tick tick tick three, and so on, and pretty soon the guy’d catch onto the numbers.

L4-cue_546
00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:35.346
Then—as he understands your number system, then—you can write lots of numbers

L4-cue_547
00:40:35.346 --> 00:40:40.246
and you could, for example, write a whole sequence of numbers that represents the weights,

L4-cue_548
00:40:40.246 --> 00:40:43.376
the proportional weights, of the different atoms, in succession.

L4-cue_549
00:40:43.376 --> 00:40:47.416
#Then say, hydrogen: 1.008, deuterium, and so on and so on.

L4-cue_550
00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:51.336
And he would-after he sat down with all those numbers and piddled around a while,

L4-cue_551
00:40:51.336 --> 00:40:55.216
would-discover that the mathematical ratios were the same as the ratios of the weights

L4-cue_552
00:40:55.216 --> 00:40:59.416
of the elements and, therefore, those names must be for the elements—and so gradually, you could,

L4-cue_553
00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:04.206
in talking to him, have a common language, in many ways, common.

L4-cue_554
00:41:04.206 --> 00:41:06.326
There are many-now comes the problem.

L4-cue_555
00:41:06.326 --> 00:41:10.346
#Suppose that he says, you fellas—after we get familiar with him, he says, "You’re very nice;

L4-cue_556
00:41:10.346 --> 00:41:12.236
now I’d like to know what you look like."

L4-cue_557
00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:15.316
And you start out, "Well, we’re about six feet tall."

L4-cue_558
00:41:15.316 --> 00:41:18.296
He says, "Six feet, how big is a foot?"

L4-cue_559
00:41:18.296 --> 00:41:25.286
"It’s very easy," you say; "six feet tall is 170 thousand million hydrogen atoms high."

L4-cue_560
00:41:25.286 --> 00:41:29.776
Well, it’s not a joke; it’s a possible way of describing six feet to someone

L4-cue_561
00:41:29.776 --> 00:41:33.716
that has no measure, assuming that we cannot send him any samples,

L4-cue_562
00:41:33.716 --> 00:41:35.486
nor can we both look at the same object.

L4-cue_563
00:41:35.486 --> 00:41:38.646
#If we have to tell him how big we are; we can do it.

L4-cue_564
00:41:38.646 --> 00:41:44.016
That’s because the laws of physics are not unchanged under a scale change.

L4-cue_565
00:41:44.016 --> 00:41:48.466
We can use that factor, use the properties of the scale to determine—I mean,

L4-cue_566
00:41:48.466 --> 00:41:51.436
you can use that fact to determine the scale.

L4-cue_567
00:41:51.436 --> 00:41:54.386
#Well, here we’ve described ourselves after telling six feet tall,

L4-cue_568
00:41:54.386 --> 00:41:57.126
and we’re so-and-so bilateral on the outside, and we look like this,

L4-cue_569
00:41:57.126 --> 00:41:59.556
and there are these prongs sticking out, and all this.

L4-cue_570
00:41:59.556 --> 00:42:02.076
And he says, "That’s very interesting; what do you look like on the inside?"

L4-cue_571
00:42:02.076 --> 00:42:06.326
So we describe the heart and so on, and we say, "Now, put the heart in on the left side."

L4-cue_572
00:42:06.326 --> 00:42:12.066
#Now the question is, how can we tell him which side is the left side?

L4-cue_573
00:42:12.066 --> 00:42:14.936
By what possible-you say, "Aw, you take beet sugar, see,

L4-cue_574
00:42:14.936 --> 00:42:21.996
and you put it in water, and it turns."

L4-cue_575
00:42:21.996 --> 00:42:24.066
Only trouble is, he has no beets up there.

L4-cue_576
00:42:24.066 --> 00:42:29.176
Or, we have no way of knowing whether the evolution, if it was even corresponding

L4-cue_577
00:42:29.176 --> 00:42:32.576
to the same proteins on Mars as here, whether the accidents

L4-cue_578
00:42:32.576 --> 00:42:38.556
of the evolution would have started with maybe the wrong—handed threads—there’s no way to tell.

L4-cue_579
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:43.986
After much thought, you see you can’t do it, so you conclude it’s impossible.

L4-cue_580
00:42:43.986 --> 00:42:48.586
#However, about five or six years ago, certain experiments ...

L4-cue_581
00:42:48.586 --> 00:42:54.076
produced all kinds of puzzles (I won’t go into details); we got into tighter

L4-cue_582
00:42:54.076 --> 00:42:58.386
and tighter difficulties, more and more paradoxical situations, until ...

L4-cue_583
00:42:58.386 --> 00:43:01.766
Lee and Yang proposed [that] maybe the principle that right

L4-cue_584
00:43:01.766 --> 00:43:06.246
and left symmetry—that nature’s the same for right and left—is not right, and that would help

L4-cue_585
00:43:06.246 --> 00:43:09.596
to explain a number of mysteries.

L4-cue_586
00:43:09.596 --> 00:43:13.196
#Lee and Yang proposed some more direct experiments to demonstrate this.

L4-cue_587
00:43:13.196 --> 00:43:18.056
I’ll just mention the most direct of all the experiments, the easiest way to tell ...

L4-cue_588
00:43:18.056 --> 00:43:23.426
(well, there were several "first" experiments which were quite clear,

L4-cue_589
00:43:23.426 --> 00:43:26.376
but the one that’s easiest to explain) is this:

L4-cue_590
00:43:26.376 --> 00:43:29.916
that when we have a radioactive disintegration ...

L4-cue_591
00:43:29.916 --> 00:43:36.586
in which an electron and a neutrino are emitted (for example, this is one that we talked

L4-cue_592
00:43:36.586 --> 00:43:42.566
about before, electron and antineutrino); this is a neutron disintegrating into a proton,

L4-cue_593
00:43:42.566 --> 00:43:44.506
an electron, and an antineutrino,

L4-cue_594
00:43:44.506 --> 00:43:47.246
or this corresponding thing can happen to a neutron in a nucleus.

L4-cue_595
00:43:47.246 --> 00:43:51.946
Anyway, there are many radioactivities in which the charge of the nucleus increases

L4-cue_596
00:43:51.946 --> 00:43:55.096
by one, and an electron comes out.

L4-cue_597
00:43:55.096 --> 00:43:59.906
#The thing that’s interesting is that if you measure the spin—electrons are spinning

L4-cue_598
00:43:59.906 --> 00:44:05.166
as they come out; if you measure the spin—you find out that they’re spinning to the left.

L4-cue_599
00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:09.046
That is a definite significance: that the electron, when it comes out of disintegration,

L4-cue_600
00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:14.506
is turning this way; that helical description is a left—hand thread.

L4-cue_601
00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:19.736
It’s as though, in the beta decay, the gun that was shooting out the electron were a rifled gun,

L4-cue_602
00:44:19.736 --> 00:44:22.046
and there’s two ways to rifle a gun,

L4-cue_603
00:44:22.046 --> 00:44:25.056
because there’s a direction—out—and then there’s a question:

L4-cue_604
00:44:25.056 --> 00:44:27.446
do you turn it this way, or that way, as you go out?

L4-cue_605
00:44:27.446 --> 00:44:33.266
The experiment is, that the electrons come from a rifled gun, rifled and twisted to the left.

L4-cue_606
00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:37.976
And so, using this fact, we can call up the Martian and say, "Listen:

L4-cue_607
00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:42.096
take radioactive stuff" (I ought to have prepared a particular example)

L4-cue_608
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:49.976
"a neutron-and look at the electrons which come from such a beta decay."

L4-cue_609
00:44:49.976 --> 00:44:53.646
#Then you define "left" by this screw thread.

L4-cue_610
00:44:53.646 --> 00:44:54.066
Let’s see ...

L4-cue_611
00:44:54.066 --> 00:45:01.016
it’ll take me some while to figure out how to do it in detail: say the electron’s going

L4-cue_612
00:45:01.016 --> 00:45:06.336
up in the direction of motion, and the way it’s spinning is into the body [from the back]

L4-cue_613
00:45:06.336 --> 00:45:10.936
on the left side—and that’s where the heart goes—something like that.

L4-cue_614
00:45:10.936 --> 00:45:14.316
I’d have to think a little bit more on it.

L4-cue_615
00:45:14.316 --> 00:45:17.596
#But anyway, it is possible to tell right from left, and thus,

L4-cue_616
00:45:17.596 --> 00:45:25.236
the law of this—that the world was symmetrical for left and right—has collapsed.

L4-cue_617
00:45:25.236 --> 00:45:31.926
#... The next thing I would like to talk about is the relationship

L4-cue_618
00:45:31.926 --> 00:45:34.756
of conservation laws to symmetry laws.

L4-cue_619
00:45:34.756 --> 00:45:44.416
We last time talked about conservation principles—conservation of energy, of momentum,

L4-cue_620
00:45:44.416 --> 00:45:47.476
angular momentum, and so on; now we’re talking about symmetry laws.

L4-cue_621
00:45:47.476 --> 00:45:51.626
It’s extremely interesting that there seems to be a deep connection

L4-cue_622
00:45:51.626 --> 00:45:54.656
between the conservation laws and the symmetry laws.

L4-cue_623
00:45:54.656 --> 00:45:58.906
This connection has its proper interpretation, at least as we understand it today,

L4-cue_624
00:45:58.906 --> 00:46:02.096
only in the knowledge of quantum mechanics.

L4-cue_625
00:46:02.096 --> 00:46:09.716
#Nevertheless, I will show you the following; I will try to explain the following:

L4-cue_626
00:46:09.716 --> 00:46:14.856
if we will assume that the laws of physics are describable

L4-cue_627
00:46:14.856 --> 00:46:18.836
by a minimum principle—that the paths are taken

L4-cue_628
00:46:18.836 --> 00:46:25.046
so that some quantity is least (an idea I described once before); if we add that the laws

L4-cue_629
00:46:25.046 --> 00:46:29.486
of nature come from a minimum principle—then we can show that if the law is

L4-cue_630
00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:33.826
such that you can move all the equipment to one side (in other words, if it’s translatable

L4-cue_631
00:46:33.826 --> 00:46:39.056
in space), then there must be conservation of momentum, that there’s a deep connection

L4-cue_632
00:46:39.056 --> 00:46:42.236
between the symmetry principles and the conservation laws,

L4-cue_633
00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:46.456
but that that connection requires that the minimum principle be assumed.

L4-cue_634
00:46:46.456 --> 00:46:52.006
#You remember at one time we discussed one way of describing physical laws,

L4-cue_635
00:46:52.006 --> 00:46:57.126
by saying that a particle goes from one place to another in a given length of time

L4-cue_636
00:46:57.126 --> 00:47:02.576
by trying different paths, and the actual path taken has this property:

L4-cue_637
00:47:02.576 --> 00:47:05.826
that there’s a certain quantity, which unfortunately happens

L4-cue_638
00:47:05.826 --> 00:47:09.466
to be called the action (which is not to be taken to signify anything,

L4-cue_639
00:47:09.466 --> 00:47:12.286
because it’s got nothing to do with action); anyway,

L4-cue_640
00:47:12.286 --> 00:47:15.936
there’s a certain quantity called the action, which you calculate on this path,

L4-cue_641
00:47:15.936 --> 00:47:20.796
and if you will calculate it for any other path, the answer’s bigger.

L4-cue_642
00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:25.056
It’s least for the real path, and that one way of describing the laws of nature is to say

L4-cue_643
00:47:25.056 --> 00:47:29.266
that the action—a certain mathematical quantity—is least

L4-cue_644
00:47:29.266 --> 00:47:33.386
for the actual path, than for any other path.

L4-cue_645
00:47:33.386 --> 00:47:36.776
#Now, another way of saying the thing is least is to say this:

L4-cue_646
00:47:36.776 --> 00:47:42.676
that if you move the path a little bit, at first it doesn’t make any difference.

L4-cue_647
00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.346
Suppose you were walking around ...

L4-cue_648
00:47:44.346 --> 00:47:50.616
on mountains, on hills—but smooth hills, please, smooth—the mathematical things

L4-cue_649
00:47:50.616 --> 00:47:54.226
that are involved here correspond to smooth things.

L4-cue_650
00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:59.396
We’re walking around on hills and valleys, and we come to a place where we’re lowest.

L4-cue_651
00:47:59.396 --> 00:48:04.816
Then I say, if you take a small step forward you won’t change your height.

L4-cue_652
00:48:04.816 --> 00:48:09.286
When you’re at the lowest (or at the highest) point, a step doesn’t make any difference

L4-cue_653
00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:13.176
in the altitude, in first approximation, whereas, if you’re on a slope,

L4-cue_654
00:48:13.176 --> 00:48:16.886
you can walk down the slope with a step—and then if you take the step

L4-cue_655
00:48:16.886 --> 00:48:19.246
in the opposite direction, you walk up.

L4-cue_656
00:48:19.246 --> 00:48:22.856
That’s the key to the reason why, when you’re at the lowest place,

L4-cue_657
00:48:22.856 --> 00:48:24.796
taking a step doesn’t make much difference,

L4-cue_658
00:48:24.796 --> 00:48:27.856
because if it did make any difference you could put the step in the opposite direction,

L4-cue_659
00:48:27.856 --> 00:48:31.486
you’d go down-I mean, if it went up one way, it would go down another way,

L4-cue_660
00:48:31.486 --> 00:48:34.476
but since this is the lowest point and you can’t go down,

L4-cue_661
00:48:34.476 --> 00:48:38.586
in first approximation the step doesn’t make any difference.

L4-cue_662
00:48:38.586 --> 00:48:43.726
We therefore know that if we move this path a little bit,

L4-cue_663
00:48:43.726 --> 00:48:47.656
in first approximation it doesn’t make any difference to the action.

L4-cue_664
00:48:47.656 --> 00:48:51.726
#Now, I want you to consider the following possible other path.

L4-cue_665
00:48:51.726 --> 00:48:55.896
First, we jump immediately over to another place here nearby.

L4-cue_666
00:48:55.896 --> 00:49:03.856
Then, we go along—(this sticks out too far to make the diagram clear, so if you’ll permit me

L4-cue_667
00:49:03.856 --> 00:49:11.216
to just change the shape of the path)—we move on exactly the corresponding path to another point,

L4-cue_668
00:49:11.216 --> 00:49:13.296
here, which is displaced the same amount, of course;

L4-cue_669
00:49:13.296 --> 00:49:16.656
this is the corresponding path, to the side.

L4-cue_670
00:49:16.656 --> 00:49:21.796
Now we have just discovered that the laws of nature are such that the action—the total amount

L4-cue_671
00:49:21.796 --> 00:49:27.956
of action—going on this path is the same, in first approximation, to that path.

L4-cue_672
00:49:27.956 --> 00:49:31.806
That’s from a minimum principle, when it’s the real motion.

L4-cue_673
00:49:31.806 --> 00:49:33.366
#Now, I show you something else.

L4-cue_674
00:49:33.366 --> 00:49:37.506
That the action on this path is the same as the action from this little cross

L4-cue_675
00:49:37.506 --> 00:49:42.416
to that little cross if the world is the same when you move everything over,

L4-cue_676
00:49:42.416 --> 00:49:46.816
because the difference of these two is only that you moved everything over.

L4-cue_677
00:49:46.816 --> 00:49:52.326
If the symmetry principle of translation in space is right, if that’s right,

L4-cue_678
00:49:52.326 --> 00:49:56.906
then the total action between the crosses is the same as between the dots.

L4-cue_679
00:49:56.906 --> 00:50:00.196
But for the true motion, the total action

L4-cue_680
00:50:00.196 --> 00:50:04.416
on this cockeyed path here is about—is very closely—the same

L4-cue_681
00:50:04.416 --> 00:50:08.366
as for the original one (subtracting equals from equals, and so on, and so on); anyway,

L4-cue_682
00:50:08.366 --> 00:50:12.866
you could probably see, therefore, that the contribution from this little section

L4-cue_683
00:50:12.866 --> 00:50:15.276
and from this little section are equal.

L4-cue_684
00:50:15.276 --> 00:50:17.796
But in making this little motion, we’re going this way,

L4-cue_685
00:50:17.796 --> 00:50:21.556
and making this one, we’re going the other way.

L4-cue_686
00:50:21.556 --> 00:50:27.536
#... So the contribution of this, taken as the effect of moving that way, and the contribution

L4-cue_687
00:50:27.536 --> 00:50:29.786
of this, thinking of it as an effect of moving that way,

L4-cue_688
00:50:29.786 --> 00:50:35.776
but making it the other sign (because it’s the other way), we see that there is a quantity here

L4-cue_689
00:50:35.776 --> 00:50:40.896
which has to match the quantity here, to cancel out—which is the effect on the action

L4-cue_690
00:50:40.896 --> 00:50:47.326
of a little tiny step in the X direction: there is that quantity, the effect on the action

L4-cue_691
00:50:47.326 --> 00:50:51.856
of a small step in the X direction, [that] is the same at the beginning as at the end.

L4-cue_692
00:50:51.856 --> 00:50:55.536
There is a quantity, therefore, that doesn’t change as time goes on,

L4-cue_693
00:50:55.536 --> 00:51:00.496
provided the minimum principle works, and the symmetry principle

L4-cue_694
00:51:00.496 --> 00:51:02.256
of displacement in space is right.

L4-cue_695
00:51:02.256 --> 00:51:05.276
#Now, this quantity which doesn’t change is, in fact,

L4-cue_696
00:51:05.276 --> 00:51:10.146
exactly the momentum that we discussed last time.

L4-cue_697
00:51:10.146 --> 00:51:14.706
A corresponding argument for the displacement in time, the delay in time,

L4-cue_698
00:51:14.706 --> 00:51:21.126
comes out as a conservation of energy; the case that if we rotate

L4-cue_699
00:51:21.126 --> 00:51:22.896
in space doesn’t make any difference,

L4-cue_700
00:51:22.896 --> 00:51:26.976
comes out as the conservation of angular momentum, and so on.

L4-cue_701
00:51:26.976 --> 00:51:30.836
That we can reflect and it makes no difference doesn’t come out to be anything simple,

L4-cue_702
00:51:30.836 --> 00:51:36.316
in the classical sense; it hasn’t, therefore, got a simple classical interpretation.

L4-cue_703
00:51:36.316 --> 00:51:41.206
People have called it parity, and they have a conservation law called the conservation

L4-cue_704
00:51:41.206 --> 00:51:46.256
of parity, but those are just complicated words in the case of the quantum mechanics;

L4-cue_705
00:51:46.256 --> 00:51:50.906
all we’re saying is, that the right and left symmetry law is not valid.

L4-cue_706
00:51:50.906 --> 00:51:55.206
#I have to mention that conservation of parity, because you may have read in the papers

L4-cue_707
00:51:55.206 --> 00:51:58.976
that the law of conservation of parity has been proved wrong; it should have been written,

L4-cue_708
00:51:58.976 --> 00:52:01.726
because it’s much easier to understand, [that] the principle

L4-cue_709
00:52:01.726 --> 00:52:06.916
that you can’t distinguish right and left has been proved wrong.

L4-cue_710
00:52:06.916 --> 00:52:10.656
#Now, I would like to say, as we go on about other symmetries,

L4-cue_711
00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:17.706
that there are a few problems—new problems: for instance, for every particle, like an electron,

L4-cue_712
00:52:17.706 --> 00:52:20.656
there’s an antiparticle (a positron).

L4-cue_713
00:52:20.656 --> 00:52:22.266
For a proton, there’s an antiproton.

L4-cue_714
00:52:22.266 --> 00:52:26.906
We can make, in principle, what we call antimatter,

L4-cue_715
00:52:26.906 --> 00:52:30.806
in which every atom has its corresponding anti pieces put together.

L4-cue_716
00:52:30.806 --> 00:52:33.156
For example, a hydrogen atom is a proton and an electron.

L4-cue_717
00:52:33.156 --> 00:52:37.466
If we take an antiproton, which is electrically negative, and a positron, and put them together,

L4-cue_718
00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:41.186
they will also make a kind of hydrogen atom, an antihydrogen atom—in principle;

L4-cue_719
00:52:41.186 --> 00:52:44.176
it’s never been made, in fact, but this is figured out,

L4-cue_720
00:52:44.176 --> 00:52:49.646
that we could make this—we could make all kinds of antimatter in the same manner.

L4-cue_721
00:52:49.646 --> 00:52:55.606
#Well, the question is, whether the matter works the same as the antimatter.

L4-cue_722
00:52:55.606 --> 00:52:57.606
As far as we know, it does.

L4-cue_723
00:52:57.606 --> 00:53:01.066
One of the laws of symmetry is that if we make stuff out of antimatter,

L4-cue_724
00:53:01.066 --> 00:53:04.356
it’ll behave the same way as do when we make the corresponding stuff out of matter.

L4-cue_725
00:53:04.356 --> 00:53:06.166
(Of course if they come together they annihilate;

L4-cue_726
00:53:06.166 --> 00:53:09.136
there would be sparks and everything else.)

L4-cue_727
00:53:09.136 --> 00:53:12.616
It was believed that this is true: that matter and antimatter have the same laws.

L4-cue_728
00:53:12.616 --> 00:53:20.886
#Now, the next question is this: once it’s found that the left and right is wrong (the left

L4-cue_729
00:53:20.886 --> 00:53:25.476
and right symmetry is wrong), an important question comes.

L4-cue_730
00:53:25.476 --> 00:53:29.246
#... If I look at this disintegration, but with antimatter—an antineutron goes

L4-cue_731
00:53:29.246 --> 00:53:36.196
into an antiproton plus an antielectron (that’s a positron) plus a neutrino—the question is,

L4-cue_732
00:53:36.196 --> 00:53:39.836
does the antimatter behave like the matter in the sense that it comes

L4-cue_733
00:53:39.836 --> 00:53:43.626
out left-hand thread, or does it behave the other way?

L4-cue_734
00:53:43.626 --> 00:53:49.266
It turns out, we think (up until a few months ago), that it behaves the opposite way;

L4-cue_735
00:53:49.266 --> 00:53:57.976
that the antimatter behaves like it goes to the right, where matter goes to the left.

L4-cue_736
00:53:57.976 --> 00:54:01.186
And so there was another principle—and [therefore], in fact,

L4-cue_737
00:54:01.186 --> 00:54:05.046
we really can’t tell a Martian which is right and left, because if he happens to be made

L4-cue_738
00:54:05.046 --> 00:54:08.606
out of antimatter, he’d get the thing the other way, because when he does his experiment,

L4-cue_739
00:54:08.606 --> 00:54:11.886
his positrons are coming out, puts the heart on the wrong side.

L4-cue_740
00:54:11.886 --> 00:54:14.926
And so you can see that if the Martian—if you telephone the Martian,

L4-cue_741
00:54:14.926 --> 00:54:20.026
and explain how to make a man, and suppose he makes one and it works, ...

L4-cue_742
00:54:20.026 --> 00:54:25.586
and you explain to him also all our social conventions, and so on.

L4-cue_743
00:54:25.586 --> 00:54:28.406
#Then when we go finally to meet this man (after he tells us how

L4-cue_744
00:54:28.406 --> 00:54:32.456
to build a sufficiently good spaceship), we go to meet this man, and you walk up to him

L4-cue_745
00:54:32.456 --> 00:54:37.406
and you put out your right hand to shake hands—if he puts out his right hand, okay,

L4-cue_746
00:54:37.406 --> 00:54:47.546
but if he puts out his left hand, watch out,

L4-cue_747
00:54:47.546 --> 00:55:00.806
because the two of you will annihilate with each other!

L4-cue_748
00:55:00.806 --> 00:55:05.846
#Now, these are all the symmetries that I have time to tell you about; I wish I could tell you

L4-cue_749
00:55:05.846 --> 00:55:09.576
about a few more, but they become more difficult technically to explain.

L4-cue_750
00:55:09.576 --> 00:55:15.996
... There are some very remarkable things, which are the near symmetries, the remarkable feature

L4-cue_751
00:55:15.996 --> 00:55:19.906
of this effect (that we can distinguish right and left) is that we can distinguish right

L4-cue_752
00:55:19.906 --> 00:55:24.836
and left only with a very weak effect, with this beta disintegration.

L4-cue_753
00:55:24.836 --> 00:55:30.246
#What it means, that nature is 99.99 indistinguishable right from left,

L4-cue_754
00:55:30.246 --> 00:55:34.026
but that there’s just one little piece, one little characteristic phenomenon,

L4-cue_755
00:55:34.026 --> 00:55:39.256
which is completely different in the sense that it’s absolutely lopsided,

L4-cue_756
00:55:39.256 --> 00:55:43.376
is a mystery that no one has the slightest idea about yet.

L4-cue_757
00:55:43.376 --> 00:57:06.000
#Thank you.
